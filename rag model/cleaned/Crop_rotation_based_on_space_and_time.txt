### DOCUMENT INFO  
- **Title/Topic:** Crop Rotation Based on Space and Time  
- **Type:** Research Paper  

### KEY CONCEPTS  
- **Main crop rotations discussed:**  
  - Rotation based on soil nutrient deficiencies (e.g., nitrogen-fixing crops like chickpea to replenish soil).  
  - Site-specific crop management to optimize nutrient use.  
- **Crops mentioned:**  
  - Potato (requires 170 kg nitrogen/hectare).  
  - Onion (requires 155 kg nitrogen/hectare).  
  - Chickpea (requires 20 kg nitrogen/hectare; fixes nitrogen for subsequent crops).  
- **Regions covered:**  
  - India (focus on Gujarat’s agricultural challenges).  
  - Developing countries with similar agro-economic conditions.  

### KEY FINDINGS  
- **Yield improvements:**  
  - Precision agriculture (e.g., remote sensing, IR absorption spectroscopy) can optimize crop selection for soil conditions, improving yields.  
- **Soil health benefits:**  
  - Leguminous crops (e.g., chickpea) restore nitrogen, reducing dependency on synthetic fertilizers.  
  - No-till farming preserves topsoil and organic humus.  
- **Disease reduction:**  
  - Crop rotation minimizes soil-borne diseases and pest buildup.  
- **Economic impact:**  
  - Reduces fertilizer costs by targeting nutrient deficiencies.  
  - Mitigates market surplus issues (e.g., Gujarat’s potato wastage) by aligning crop choices with local demand.  

### NUMERICAL DATA/TABLES  
- **Nitrogen requirements per hectare:**  
  - Potato: 170 kg.  
  - Onion: 155 kg.  
  - Chickpea: 20 kg.  
- **IR absorption spectra ranges for nutrients:**  
  - N-H bond: 3300–3500 cm⁻¹.  
  - N-O bond: 1345–1385 cm⁻¹.  

### CONCLUSIONS  
- **Main recommendations for farmers:**  
  - Adopt precision agriculture tools (e.g., remote sensing hovers) to map soil nutrients and rotate crops accordingly.  
  - Grow nitrogen-fixing crops (e.g., chickpea) in nitrogen-deficient zones to naturally replenish soil.  
- **Best practices for crop rotation:**  
  - Align crop choices with soil nutrient levels and local market demand to avoid surplus.  
  - Prioritize organic solutions (e.g., leguminous plants) over synthetic fertilizers to sustain soil health.
