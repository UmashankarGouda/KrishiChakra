### DOCUMENT INFO  
- **Title/Topic:** Precision agriculture for improving crop yield predictions: a literature review  
- **Type:** Review Article  

### KEY CONCEPTS  
- **Main crop rotations discussed:** Not explicitly mentioned, but the focus is on precision agriculture (PA) techniques for yield prediction.  
- **Crops mentioned:** Maize (corn), wheat (indirectly via remote sensing examples).  
- **Regions covered:** Global (climate change impacts, food security challenges).  

### KEY FINDINGS  
- **Yield improvements:**  
  - Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques (e.g., CNNs, LSTMs) improve yield predictions by analyzing spatiotemporal data.  
  - Hybrid models (e.g., CNN-LSTM) outperform traditional methods (e.g., 74% accuracy for wheat prediction).  
- **Soil health benefits:**  
  - Remote sensing (e.g., NDVI, NDVIre) helps monitor soil and crop health, optimizing resource use (fertilizers, water).  
- **Disease reduction:**  
  - Early detection of pests/droughts via ML models enables proactive mitigation.  
- **Economic impact:**  
  - PA reduces operational costs by optimizing inputs (fertilizers, pesticides) and minimizing waste.  

### NUMERICAL DATA/TABLES  
- **Vegetation Indices (VIs) for yield prediction:**  
  - NDVI, NDVIre, GNDVI, EVI, LSWI, etc. (Table 1).  
- **Accuracy metrics:**  
  - CNN-LSTM model achieved 74% accuracy for wheat yield prediction.  
  - DNN-based recommendation engine (CROPUP) reached 99.3% accuracy in crop suitability analysis.  

### CONCLUSIONS  
- **Main recommendations for farmers:**  
  - Adopt precision agriculture tools (sensors, drones, ML models) for real-time field monitoring.  
  - Combine remote sensing (e.g., NDVI) with weather/soil data for early yield forecasting.  
- **Best practices for crop rotation:**  
  - Not explicitly detailed, but PA techniques (e.g., variable-rate fertilization) can complement rotation strategies by addressing field variability.
