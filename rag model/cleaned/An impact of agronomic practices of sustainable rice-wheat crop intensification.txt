### DOCUMENT INFO  
- **Title/Topic**: Impact of agronomic practices on sustainable rice-wheat crop intensification in the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains  
- **Type**: Research Paper  

### KEY CONCEPTS  
- **Main crop rotations discussed**: Rice-Wheat-Greengram system  
- **Crops mentioned**: Rice, Wheat, Greengram  
- **Regions covered**: Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (EIGP), India  

### KEY FINDINGS  
- **Yield improvements**:  
  - Zero-till wheat (ZTW) produced **4.6% higher yield** than conventional tillage.  
  - Direct-seeded rice (DSR) yields became comparable to puddled transplanted rice (PTR) by the fourth year.  
  - System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and System of Wheat Intensification (SWI) showed comparable rice yields to conventional systems.  
- **Soil health benefits**:  
  - Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices (minimal soil disturbance, residue retention) improved soil health and reduced degradation.  
  - Inclusion of greengram in rotation enhanced soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation.  
- **Disease reduction**:  
  - Residue retention reduced the need for burning, preserving soil microbiota and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  
- **Economic impact**:  
  - CA-based systems yielded **10.8% higher net returns** than conventional systems.  
  - Energy productivity under CA was **14–36% higher** than conventional methods.  

### NUMERICAL DATA/TABLES  
- **Water use**: DSR consumed **6.8% less water** than transplanted rice.  
- **Global Warming Potential (GWP)**: CA-based systems reduced GWP by **8–10%** compared to conventional methods.  
- **Residue burning impact**: Burning 1 ton of rice residue loses **5.5 kg N, 2.3 kg P, 25 kg K, and 1.2 kg S**.  

### CONCLUSIONS  
- **Main recommendations for farmers**:  
  - Adopt **zero-till practices** for wheat and greengram to improve yields and reduce costs.  
  - Transition to **direct-seeded rice (DSR)** to save water and achieve comparable yields over time.  
  - Integrate **greengram** into rotations to enhance soil health and profitability.  
- **Best practices for crop rotation**:  
  - Use **triple zero-till systems** (ZT DSR-ZT wheat-ZT greengram) for sustainability.  
  - Retain **crop residues** to improve soil health and reduce environmental impact.  
  - Prioritize **early wheat sowing** to avoid terminal heat stress and yield losses.
