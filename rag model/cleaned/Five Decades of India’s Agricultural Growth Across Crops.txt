### DOCUMENT INFO  
- **Title/Topic**: Five Decades of India’s Agricultural Growth Across Crops: Emerging Trends and Patterns  
- **Type**: Research Paper  

### KEY CONCEPTS  
- **Main crop rotations discussed**: Shift from foodgrains (cereals, pulses) to high-value crops (fruits, vegetables, oilseeds, fibers, spices).  
- **Crops mentioned**:  
  - Foodgrains (cereals, coarse cereals, pulses)  
  - Non-foodgrains (fruits, vegetables, oilseeds, fiber crops, condiments/spices, sugarcane)  
- **Regions covered**: National-level analysis (India).  

### KEY FINDINGS  
- **Yield improvements**:  
  - Decline in area under foodgrains (11.62%) and coarse cereals (16.78%) from TE 1970-71 to TE 2020-21.  
  - Fruits and vegetables now contribute the largest share (27.77%) of total crop output value.  
- **Soil health benefits**: Regenerative agriculture and integrated farming systems (IFS) recommended for sustainability.  
- **Economic impact**:  
  - High-value crops (HVCs) occupy 20.12% of gross cropped area (GCA) but contribute 43.58% of total output value.  
  - Staple crops (cereals, pulses, oilseeds) occupy 77.33% of GCA but contribute only 46.37% of output value.  
- **Disease reduction**: Not explicitly mentioned, but diversification is implied to reduce monoculture risks.  

### NUMERICAL DATA/TABLES  
- **Area shifts**:  
  - Foodgrains’ share in GCA declined by 11.62% (TE 1970-71 to TE 2020-21).  
  - Coarse cereals area fell by 16.78% in the same period.  
- **Output value shares (TE 2020-21)**:  
  - Fruits/vegetables: 27.77%  
  - Cereals: 27.41%  
  - Oilseeds: Significant increase (exact % not specified).  
- **Growth rates**: No crop achieved >4% annual production growth (1967–2021).  

### CONCLUSIONS  
- **Main recommendations for farmers**:  
  - Diversify towards high-value crops (oilseeds, pulses, horticulture).  
  - Adopt small-holding farm technologies and regenerative agriculture (e.g., IFS models).  
- **Best practices for crop rotation**:  
  - Prioritize irrigation, credit, and market access for HVCs.  
  - Use MSP as a signal for diversification; state coordination needed for sustainable shifts.  
  - Focus on less water-intensive crops to align with doubling farmers’ income goals.
