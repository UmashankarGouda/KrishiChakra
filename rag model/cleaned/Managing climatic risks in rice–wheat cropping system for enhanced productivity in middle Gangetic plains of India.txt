### DOCUMENT INFO  
- **Title/Topic:** Managing climatic risks in rice–wheat cropping system for enhanced productivity in middle Gangetic plains of India  
- **Type:** Research Paper  

### KEY CONCEPTS  
- **Main crop rotations discussed:** Rice–Wheat Cropping System (RWCS)  
- **Crops mentioned:** Rice (*Rajendra Mahsuri-1*), Wheat (*HD-2967*), Summer Green Gram  
- **Regions covered:** Middle Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), Bihar, India (17 villages across 13 districts)  

### KEY FINDINGS  
- **Yield improvements:**  
  - Timely sown rice achieved **5.2 t/ha** yield, while late-sown rice had lower productivity.  
  - Wheat sown before **15 November** yielded **4.9 t/ha**.  
  - Overall system productivity reached **10.1 t/ha** with a cropping intensity of **300%** (including summer green gram).  
- **Soil health benefits:** Early rice transplanting and timely wheat sowing reduced climatic stresses (e.g., terminal heat in wheat).  
- **Disease reduction:** Timely sowing avoided overlapping of critical phenological stages with adverse weather (e.g., low temperatures during rice flowering).  
- **Economic impact:**  
  - Community irrigation using **3-hp single-phase pumps** reduced irrigation costs to **INR 300/ha** (vs. INR 6000/ha for diesel pumps).  
  - Higher water productivity (**85.8% increase**) in timely sown rice.  

### NUMERICAL DATA/TABLES  
- Rice yield: **5.2 t/ha** (timely) vs. lower (late-sown).  
- Wheat yield: **4.9 t/ha** (timely sown).  
- System productivity: **10.1 t/ha** (rice–wheat + green gram).  
- Cropping intensity: **300%**.  
- Irrigation cost comparison:  
  - Diesel pump: **INR 6000/ha**.  
  - Single-phase pump: **INR 300/ha**.  

### CONCLUSIONS  
- **Main recommendations for farmers:**  
  - Transplant rice early (**15–20 June**) using assured irrigation to enable timely wheat sowing (**before 15 November**).  
  - Adopt community irrigation with **3-hp single-phase pumps** for cost efficiency.  
  - Include summer green gram to maximize cropping intensity.  
- **Best practices for crop rotation:**  
  - Align planting dates to avoid climatic risks (e.g., terminal heat in wheat, low temperatures during rice flowering).  
  - Use long-duration rice varieties (e.g., *Rajendra Mahsuri-1*, 150 days) for timely harvest.  
  - Apply **2–3 irrigations** to wheat based on soil type and evaporative demand.
