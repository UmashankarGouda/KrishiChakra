### DOCUMENT INFO  
- **Title/Topic**: An Online Optimization-Based Decision Support Tool for Small Farmers in India  
- **Type**: Research Paper  

### KEY CONCEPTS  
- **Main crop rotations discussed**: Crop planning and rotation optimization using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and reinforcement learning.  
- **Crops mentioned**: Beetroot, bottle brinjal, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumber, French beans, green capsicum, tomato.  
- **Regions covered**: India (focus on small farmers in Telangana).  

### KEY FINDINGS  
- **Yield improvements**: Access to decision support tools can reduce revenue risk and improve yields by optimizing crop choices.  
- **Soil health benefits**: Crop rotation prevents soil-borne pests and diseases by avoiding consecutive planting of crops from the same family.  
- **Disease reduction**: Sequential planting constraints (e.g., avoiding same-family crops) reduce disease risk.  
- **Economic impact**: Algorithmic crop planning preserves utility and matches offline planning performance with reduced computational costs.  

### NUMERICAL DATA/TABLES  
- **Simulation duration**: January 1, 2022 – December 31, 2022 (26 timesteps of 14 days each).  
- **Key parameters**: Smoothing parameter (θ = 0.5), discount factor (γ = 0.95), constraint violation penalty (k = -1e5).  
- **Performance**: Achieved equivalent cumulative revenue to offline methods with reduced runtime.  

### CONCLUSIONS  
- **Main recommendations for farmers**:  
  - Use decision support tools to optimize crop rotations based on real-time market prices and seasonal constraints.  
  - Avoid planting crops from the same family consecutively to reduce disease risk.  
- **Best practices for crop rotation**:  
  - Align planting schedules with crop calendars and seasonality data.  
  - Prioritize crops with stable relative profitability and harvest frequency.  
  - Monitor market prices dynamically to adjust planting decisions.
