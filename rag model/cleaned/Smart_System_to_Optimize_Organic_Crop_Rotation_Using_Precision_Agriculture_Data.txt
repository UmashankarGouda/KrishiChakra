### DOCUMENT INFO  
- **Title/Topic**: Smart System to Optimize Organic Crop Rotation Using Precision Agriculture Data  
- **Type**: Research Paper  

### KEY CONCEPTS  
- **Main crop rotations discussed**:  
  - Vegetable and root crop rotations (e.g., legumes, leafy greens, tubers).  
  - Climate-resilient rotations based on real-time weather data.  
- **Crops mentioned**:  
  - Vegetables (optimal NPK: N 0.1–0.2%, P 0.05–0.1%, K 0.2–0.3%).  
  - Root crops (optimal NPK: N 0.75–1%, P 0.375–0.5%, K 1.25–1.5%).  
- **Regions covered**:  
  - Nuwara Eliya district, Sri Lanka (primary focus).  

### KEY FINDINGS  
- **Yield improvements**:  
  - Data-driven crop recommendations increased yields by optimizing NPK levels and crop suitability.  
- **Soil health benefits**:  
  - Reduced reliance on synthetic fertilizers, improved water retention, and enhanced aggregate stability.  
  - Lower greenhouse gas emissions due to decreased nitrogen fertilizer use.  
- **Disease reduction**:  
  - Crop rotation reduced pest/disease incidence by breaking life cycles (e.g., via legume inclusion).  
- **Economic impact**:  
  - Lower input costs (reduced fertilizer/pesticide use) and higher productivity from optimized rotations.  

### NUMERICAL DATA/TABLES  
- **Soil nutrient thresholds**:  
  - Vegetables: N 0.1–0.2%, P 0.05–0.1%, K 0.2–0.3%.  
  - Root crops: N 0.75–1%, P 0.375–0.5%, K 1.25–1.5%.  
- **Model accuracy**:  
  - Random Forest Model achieved the highest accuracy for crop recommendations.  

### CONCLUSIONS  
- **Main recommendations for farmers**:  
  - Use IoT sensors (NPK, weather) to guide crop selection and rotation schedules.  
  - Prioritize leguminous crops to naturally fix nitrogen and reduce fertilizer dependency.  
- **Best practices for crop rotation**:  
  - Rotate crops from different families to disrupt pest/disease cycles.  
  - Integrate real-time weather data to adapt rotations for climate resilience.  
  - Continuously update rotation plans using soil analytics and machine learning insights.
