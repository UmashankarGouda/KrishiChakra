Abstract--- The growth of any organic farming needs 
vital energy source which will keep flourish and also 
increase yield. Crops need nutrients. But we used to 
substitute by fertilizers, which can result in 
agriculture runoffs or extra input from the farmers. 
This paper tries to suggest an alternate for this 
dependency by introducing the crop rotation based 
on the space and time. Agriculture can be conceived 
as management of land parcels and improving the 
productivity. It serves only contemporary society and 
also our future generations. The major factor lies in 
the part of productivity by using the landscape 
structure and crop management. 
 
Keywords:

I.INTRODUCTION 
 
It is expected that the world’s population will reach 
9.2 billion people, 34 percent higher than today by 
2050[1]. Much of this growth will happen in 
developing countries. To keep up with rising 
populations and income growth, global food 
production must increase by 70 percent in order to 
be able to feed the world. Precision agriculture is 
the call of the day, wherein the soil, a complex 
mixture of all micro and macro nutrients, is 
accurately mapped for its compositions so as to 
reduce the dependence on the artificial additives 
like fertilizers. NASA has been very supportive, 
along with IBM, in providing services to farmers of 
US for getting better yield through precision 
agriculture [2]. The data obtained from on the field 
sensors and remote sensing helps analyze the 
condition of the soil, get its nutritional property. 
Though this can’t be equal to that of the direct 
observation by the farmers it is more useful when 
implementing for larger farms. India is an agro 
based country, ranked 7th on the Gross Domestic

Product (GDP) with the 2nd largest population in  
the world, with almost 50% of its population 
depending on agriculture yet having only 17.1% of 
GDP contribution [3]. The land under cultivation is 
drastically decreasing having to meet the habitation 
requirement 
of 
the 
exponentially 
growing 
population. Thus there is a demand for more crop 
production in a comparatively small plot, leading to 
increased utilization of artificial crop enhancers 
like fertilizers which make the soil less cultivable 
every time it is used. Also there have been 
incidents in Gujarat where the supply of potato 
crops was so high than demand, which lead to 
wastage of the crops [4]. This scenario in Gujarat 
could have been avoided if only the alternative to 
these crops were properly analyzed. 
Agricultural runoff has been a major cause of the 
water pollution these days and they may cause 
many kinds of diseases in both humans and animals 
that consume or live in it. Also additional nutrients 
mean wastage of fertilizers which is actually an 
additive cost that can be cut short to provide better 
profit to the farmers. Thus an optimal solution 
would be to study the soil pattern and aid with only 
those nutrients as required. In case of nutrients 
when lesser than the required, organic farming 
could be used. There has been more than one way 
to analyze the soil nutrient content. 
In this paper, we go in for this precision farming by 
remote sensing. It aims at providing a solution to 
these issues by introducing the concept of crop 
rotation based on space and time. The paper has 
been classified into four phases, the first section 
deals with the introduction. Second being the 
analysis of the past and current trends. Then, the 
proposed methodology. Last the conclusion and 
future indications.

II.PROPOSED MODEL 
 
 A.Phase I: Sensing And gathering the data:  
 
Sudduth et al [5] and Adamchuk et al [6] gave a 
broad overview of the various types of the sensors. 
Hak-Jin Kim et al [7] did an extensive study on the 
techniques used for the site specific crop 
management, where fertilizers are applied based on 
the spatial requirement. The approaches to nutrient 
sensing can be broadly classified into the 
categories, which include electrochemical sensing 
that uses ion selective electrodes(ISE) to generate a 
voltage proportional to the nutrient observed 
,optical sensing that uses reflectance spectroscopy 
to detect the level of energy reflected/absorbed by 
the nutrients, Mechanical sensors which measure 
the force from a tool engaged in the soil, Acoustic 
sensors that quantify a sound produced by the 
interacting tool, Pneumatic sensors that assess the 
ability to inject air into the soil and electrical and 
electromagnetic sensors that measure the electrical 
properties of the affected composition of the tested 
soil[8]. NIRS technology has been applied in many 
fields including food industry, petrochemical 
industry, and in agriculture because of its testing 
speed, low cost, and non-destructive as well as 
real-time testing [9]. Sneha J.Bansod et al[8] gave an 
overview on the NIR spectroscopy based soil 
nitrogen 
sensing, 
wherein 
the 
multivariate 
calibration techniques for improved accuracy are 
briefed. The idea of on the go soil macronutrient 
sensing has its roots in as early as 1990s. Adsett et 
al [10] designed a tractor-mounted field monitoring 
system prototype to measure soil nitrate levels in 
the fields using ISEs, giving a response time of less 
than 20s. Viscarra Rossel et al [11] built a soil 
analysis system comprising a batch-type mixing 
chamber with two inlets. Adamchuk et al [12] 
developed an automated sampling system for soil 
pH electrode in direct contact with moist soil 
collected by the sampling system, which could 
measure the pH while taking soil samples at a pre-
selected depth between 0 and 20 cm every 8s. Veris 
Mobile Sensor Platform made in Veris Technology 
Inc.,Salina, Kansas,Usa[12] is a commercially viable 
prototype to sense the soil on the go. Though there 
are so many approaches and tools for on the go soil 
nutrient sensing, there are still the issues like 
clogging of the soil sampler because of varying 
size of the soil particles, variation in the color 
range comparatively on conversions to better 
comparable coloring schemes. Each nutrient has its       
own frequency called as spectral signature which is 
specific to that particular element. We can use this 
variation to extract the data from the image 
observed. 
 
B. Phase II: Decision Making 
 
The crop to be grown on a particular plot depends 
on various factors like the soil’s nutrient content, 
variation based on the local demand and current 
resource demand expectancy which depends on the 
probable crop the neighbors will grow. These 
factors when properly analyzed will lead to a better 
profit. There is sure to be a variation in the level of 
nutrients in the soil in within the given plot of the 
soil, and to neutralize this, farmers usually do 
tilling. But it has been found that tilling can result 
in a loss of topsoil which contains the much 
essential organic humus, so no-till farming is 
preferred. But the problem remains unsolved in this 
case, so we go on for the remote sensing, wherein 
the additive fertilizers are only added in the places 
where they are needed. This can still be refined by 
instead going for a more organic solution, wherein

we plant only the crop suitable for the conditions in 
that particular place which can substitute the 
deficient nutrient for the next plantation. For 
instance, in case of nitrogen deficiency, we can 
grow leguminous plants that can fix nitrogen for 
the better soil nitrogen content in the next cycle. 
But this does not mean any crop that is suitable can 
be grown. Only those crops that have a demand in 
the market and can produce considerable profit can 
be grown. Also if the crop is produced in surplus, 
even if the demand is high, there is a dip in the 
profit produced. So we need to consider the crops 
grown in the neighboring fields too.

III.METHODOLOGY 
 
Indian subcontinent has many villages. Indian 
farmers cannot afford a sophisticated on the go 
sensor. Every village can have a solar powered 
battery backup hover which flies at a particular 
range above the ground, sensing the soil nutrients 
using IR absorption spectrum, capturing the 
sunlight in a battery during the daytime and 
collecting the data during the night to avoid stray 
light, so as to provide an improved and accurate 
mapping of nutrients so that, Instead of depending 
on artificial fertilizers, farmer can grow specific 
crops, in the specific place that suits it, within the 
field. For instance, if a soil has lower nitrogen 
content farmers can grow.

plants with nodules which would fix nitrogen for 
the next cycle or employ slash and burn for that 
particular region in case of potassium deficit. In 
this paper, we consider the nitrogen requirement of 
potato, onion and chickpea plants. Potato plants 
require nitrogen content of 170 kg per hectare, and 
onions requirement is 155 kg per hectare while 
chickpea being a plant with nodule, needs only 
20kg per hectare. So we grow chickpea to improve 
the nitrogen level in the soil [14].

IV.ALGORITHM 
 
 
 
The data are collected and scrutinized for various 
nutrient contents in the soil. The area of land is 
considered in terms of m2. The current considered 
pixel value is taken as x. If the value of ‘x’ lies in 
the range of N-H between 3300 and 3500, plot the 
area in red. If the value of ‘x’ lies in the range of 
N-O between 1345 and 1385, plot the area in blue. 
If the value of pixel is neither of the above range 
plot the area in white. Separate the three areas into 
red, blue and white. Considering the area of the 
red, if the area is greater than 170, then plant the 
potato in that area. If the area of red lies between 
83 and 170, then plant onion. If the area of red has 
neither of the above values plant chickpea. Thus, 
making various analysis and having the exact data, 
It is being sent to the repository, to be the main 
knowledge and resource hub of new agriculture

V.CONCLUSION 
 
 
Everybody know agriculture is vital role of Indian 
economy and also the backbone of India. The 60 
percent villages of India depend agriculture Smart 
farming is the need of the day, but not all farmers 
can afford to own smart machines. So we go in for 
a common hover in the hub that can gather the data 
and analyze it both locally in field and global 
demand can be checked. The methodology will 
help to improve the net profit of the farmers having 
a better organic farming practice. The method will 
help to get rid of poverty of farmers and 
agricultural runoff. Nowadays the information 
technology plays key role in agriculture industry.
