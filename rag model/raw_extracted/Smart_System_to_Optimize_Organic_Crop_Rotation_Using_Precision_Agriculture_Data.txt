Abstract—Optimizing organic crop rotation and effectively 
managing pests and diseases remain a significant challenge for 
farmers. In this research, we propose a Smart System to 
Optimize Organic Crop Rotation using Precision Agriculture 
Data. The system leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technology, 
machine learning (ML) algorithms, and cloud computing to 
enhance decision-making and improve productivity in organic 
farming. The proposed system integrates multiple components 
to provide farmers with informed decisions for optimized crop 
rotation. Soil sensors collect data on soil health, which is then 
analyzed using a multi-objective optimization technique to 
determine the best crop for a given soil sample. Real-time 
weather data is incorporated to enable climate-resilient farming 
practices and help farmers make educated choices in selecting 
crops and implementing rotation plans. Additionally, a cloud 
computing-based model is developed for pest and disease 
identification, providing farmers with effective solutions to 
combat these challenges in organic methodologies. By 
leveraging IoT, ML, and cloud computing, our system proposes 
farmers a more efficient and effective approach to managing 
their crops. The system provides real-time data-driven 
recommendations on fertilizer selection and crop rotation, 
leading to improved crop growth, increased yields, and reduced 
environmental impact. Moreover, by adopting organic farming 
practices, the system contributes to the sustainable development 
of the agricultural sector.

I. INTRODUCTION  
To pursuit of sustainable agriculture, this research aims to 
develop an integrated smart agricultural system that 
encompasses crucial functionalities to enhance organic 
farming practices. The primary focus lies on optimized crop 
rotation, precision agriculture data integration, smart pest and 
disease management, and climate-aware decision support. The 
core functionality of the system revolves around optimized 
crop rotation and soil analytics. [1] By utilizing real-time data 
from IoT sensors, the system will assess soil parameters and 
crop growth patterns to generate personalized crop rotation 
plans and most optimized crops for a particular soil in real 
time.This approach maximizes crop yields, fosters sustainable 
practices, and reduces reliance on synthetic fertilizers. 
Another vital aspect of our research is the integration of 
precision agriculture data. By analyzing weather patterns, crop 
health, and soil variability, farmers will gain valuable insights 
into resource-efficient crop management. This data-driven 
approach optimizes agricultural practices and minimizes 
environmental impacts. To combat challenges posed by pests 
and diseases, we propose a web-based platform with image 
recognition and augmented reality (AR) capabilities. This 
smart system empowers farmers to swiftly identify and 
manage pests and diseases using non-chemical solutions, 
promoting organic farming sustainability. [2] Additionally, 
this research envisions a climate-aware decision support 
system. Analyzing local weather conditions, including 
temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and 
extreme events, farmers will receive climate-specific 
recommendations for crop selection and cultivation strategies. 
This approach bolsters crop resilience against climate change 
and optimizes yields under varying weather conditions. By 
unifying these diverse functionalities, this integrated smart 
agricultural system seeks to empower farmers with an all-
encompassing solution. The fusion of technology, data-driven 
insights, and sustainable practices will pave the way for a 
more resilient, productive, and environmentally conscious 
organic farming sector, contributing to the broader goals of 
global food security and sustainable agriculture. 
II. BACKGROUND STUDY 
Agriculture is an essential area of the global 
economy, providing food, fiber, and raw materials to various 
industries. However, conventional farming practices would 
engender negative environmental impacts such as soil 
degradation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss. As a 
result, there is an increasing demand for sustainable 
agricultural practices that prioritize social fairness, economic 
viability, and environmental protection. 
Organic farming has emerged as a promising 
alternative that focuses on natural inputs and the preservation

of soil health. Key components of organic farming include 
crop rotation and soil analytics. Crop rotation involves 
alternating different crops in a single field, improving soil 
fertility, reducing erosion, and controlling pests and diseases. 
Soil analytics, on the other hand, utilizes advanced 
technologies to monitor soil properties such as moisture, 
temperature, and nutrient levels, enabling farmers to make 
informed decisions about crop selection and management. 
The use of external nitrogen, phosphorus, and 
potassium (NPK) fertilizers in conventional agriculture has 
been a common practice to provide additional nutrients 
necessary for plant growth and development. However, the 
use of external fertilizers has been associated with several 
negative effects on soil health and the environment. Nitrogen 
fertilizers, for instance, can lead to groundwater pollution by 
adding nitrates and can harm aquatic ecosystems. Phosphorus 
fertilizers can contribute to soil degradation and potassium 
fertilizers can lead to soil salinization. Frequent use of 
external fertilizers can make it harder for plants to absorb 
nutrients and water, resulting in reduced growth and yield [2]. 
Careful management of external NPK fertilizers is 
essential to avoid these negative impacts on soil health and 
the environment. Crop rotation, as an alternative to external 
fertilizers, offers several benefits to agricultural and soil 
systems. It reduces weed, insect, and plant disease 
occurrence, improves soil physical, chemical, and biological 
characteristics, and enhances water retention capacity and 
aggregate stability. Additionally, crop rotation reduces 
greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the need for nitrogen 
fertilizer and promotes nitrogen fixation by rhizobacteria in 
leguminous crops. 
The importance of organic farming and crop rotation 
in sustainable agriculture is further emphasized in various 
research papers. IoT-based soil nutrient analysis and 
monitoring systems have been developed to address the 
challenges faced by farmers, enabling real-time data 
collection on soil conditions, and optimizing agricultural 
practices [5]. Climate-resilient organic farming techniques, 
incorporating precision agriculture technologies and weather 
monitoring, have been proposed to adapt to changing weather 
patterns and enhance crop productivity while minimizing 
environmental impacts [6] [7]. ML algorithms, and image 
processing have been utilized for insect identification and 
disease recognition in crops [8] [9]. 
III. METHODOLOGY 
A. Crop Rotation Creation with Precision Agriculture Data 
Our research aims to provide farmers with a tool to 
facilitate organic crop rotation based on precise data gathered 
through IoT devices, focusing primarily on the Nuwara Eliya 
district in Sri Lanka. This research is twofold, interlinking 
agricultural 
considerations 
(50%) 
and 
technological 
applications (50%). 
1) Platform and User Interface :The system comprises a 
mobile application, allowing farmers to input parameters, 
including soil's NPK level, area temperature, prior crops' 
data, pest attack history, desired crop rotation duration, and 
crop family choices. This data is transmitted to a cloud-hosted 
API, integrated with a rule engine, which processes this 
information using expert-defined rules to generate a 
personalized crop rotation plan returned to the user. An 
accompanying web-based rule editor (Drools Workbench) 
enables agricultural experts to continuously refine the rule-
base, reflecting evolving agricultural insights [3].  
2) Implementation: The core of the system is a rule-based 
engine developed using the Drools framework, deployed on 
a KIE server. Drools was selected due to its capability to 
handle complex decision logic and the flexibility to modify 
rules without changing the core application [4]. 
3) Rule Definition:For the targeted region (Nuwaraeliya), 
we identified viable crop [5]families (Vegetables and Root 
Crops) based on climatic and soil characteristics. For 
vegetables, optimal soil composition should be Nitrogen (N): 
0.1-0.2%, Phosphorus (P): 0.05-0.1%, and Potassium (K): 
0.2-0.3% [5]. For root crops, it's Nitrogen (N): 0.75-1%, 
Phosphorus (P): 0.375-0.5%, and Potassium (K): 1.25-1.5% . 
4) The rule engine operates sequentially : 
a) Validates the compatibility of the NPK values 
against crop family choices. 
b) Assesses the feasibility of cultivating selected crops 
based on soil health. 
c) Evaluates past pest attacks and suggests alternative 
crops if necessary. 
d) Factors in area-specific temperature, suggesting 
crops that thrive in those conditions.

e) Constructs a crop rotation schedule based on the 
farmer's desired timeframe, with each crop's unique 
cultivation period considered. 
 
B. Soil based crop recommendation 
Soil-Based Crop Recommendation Component aims to 
recommend the most suitable crops for a given agricultural 
field based on soil nutrient levels. In fig.2. it shows an 
overview diagram of the soil-based crop recommendation 
component. To achieve this, an IoT NPK (Nitrogen, 
Phosphorus, and Potassium) sensor (JXBS-3001-NPK-RS) 
was deployed in the target field to measure the soil nutrient 
concentrations. [6] . When configuring the NPK sensor with 
the Arduino module NodeMCU ESP8266 was used because 
of its ability for wireless WIFI communication.  
Those gathered data from the NPK sensor is then used with 
an algorithm to find the Crop Suitability Index (CSI)  and 
generated a dataset with relevant N P K levels and most 
suitable crop. The CSI represents the compatibility of each 
crop with specific NPK levels in the soil, enabling effective 
crop recommendations. Additionally, an external dataset was 
acquired from reputable agricultural sources, containing 
information about ideal soil compositions and crops that thrive 
under specific NPK level ranges. Then both data sets are used 
to train a machine learning model to ensure the effectiveness 
of the component. The datasets underwent pre-processing to 
remove outliers and handle missing values, ensuring data 
quality and consistency.  
Three 
ML 
models 
were 
considered 
for 
crop 
recommendation: Regression Model, Decision Tree Model, 
and Random Forest Model. The external dataset was divided 
into training and testing sets. Each model was trained on the 
training set and evaluated using its accuracy. [7]Among the 
evaluated models, the Random Forest Model showed the 
highest accuracy in predicting the optimal crop for a particular 
soil sample. The trained Random Forest model was 
continuously fed real-time NPK data from the sensor and 
processed it to recommend the most suitable crop based on the 
current soil conditions. [8] [9]. 
The Mobile application was developed and configured 
with a python back end where NPK sensor data is taken in and 
returns the most optimized crops for a particular soil sample 
in real time which resulting in high yields with low fertilizers. 
The integration of the Soil-Based Crop Recommendation 
Component with the Smart System enabled seamless 
communication and data exchange between components. The 
combined outputs from each component were fused using data 
binding techniques, and the decision-making process utilized 
the combined information to determine the best-suited crop 
rotation plan for the agricultural field.  
C. Crop suggesion using real time weather data  
Therefore, predicting the weather for a given time is part 
of the weather recommendation component. The information 
we gather, such as the temperature and humidity, is used in 
this process. We can collect this weather-related data with the 
aid of our unique apparatus, which combines a DHT 11 sensor 
and an Arduino Uno board. The device performs as a weather 
sleuth, constantly keeping an eye on the temperature and 
humidity levels outside. So might discover what the weather 
typically does by looking at the data our equipment collects. 
We can learn when it will be sunny, wet, or humid, for 
instance. Farmers should be aware crops that support different 
kind of weather patterns [10]. According to the weather 
patterns, farmers are advised on which crops are most likely 
to thrive on their farms at certain times of year. 
Furthermore, it predicts the weather in the future based on 
empirical data. This system foretells the future by analyzing 
what has already occurred. This aids farmers in anticipating 
the weather and preparing for it. The system provides 
recommendations on when to sow and produce crops based on 
the collected data and projections. Crops that thrive in certain 
conditions can be recommended when indications suggest a 
warm and rainy environment. From this, a tool has been 
developed that provides farmers with weather information and 
planting advice. The unique tool analyzes the weather, 
determines its implications, and then offers guidance to 
farmers. It's akin to having a weather and farming-savvy 
companion constantly available for advice. This is how 
research advances and educates farming. 
D. Object detection using yolov5 and augmented reality 
Through the flexible Three.js platform, this research aims 
to establish a novel and ground-breaking methodology that 
strategically converges the exceptional accuracy of the 
YOLOv5 object detection model with the immersive and 
interactive potentials of AR. The main goal of the research is 
to offer a highly sophisticated solution that is both novel and 
well-suited for the complex and multifaceted problem of 
precise pest identification in the ever-changing and 
convoluted agricultural landscape. 
1) YOLOv5 Model for Precise Pest Detection : The 
thorough collection of an enormous and extraordinarily 
varied dataset, which includes a broad range of crops and 
possible pest species, forms the core of this study[19]. Every 
pest instance in this dataset has been painstakingly vetted and 
prepped, and bounding boxes have been placed precisely to 
annotate each case of the pest. The YOLOv5 model goes 
through a tough training routine after this painstaking

annotation procedure, which is strengthened further by the 
judicious insertion of innovative data augmentation 
techniques[16]. A battery of tests using well-known metrics 
including precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the 
model’s 
accuracy 
and 
effectiveness 
rigorously 
and 
thoroughly in the field of pest detection. This thorough 
evaluation approach makes sure that the model is perfectly 
tailored to function well in real-world scenarios of pest 
2) Enhanced 
Augmented 
Reality 
with 
Three.js:A 
sophisticated virtual world that painstakingly replicates the 
subtleties of real agricultural landscapes is painstakingly built 
using the potent powers built into Three.js[20]. The 
augmented reality experience thrives in this dynamic virtual 
environment that was meticulously created. Precision camera 
calibration and a precise and smooth spatial alignment are 
made possible by the expert tracking and integration of AR 
markers[17]. Pests are automatically detected and seamlessly 
placed onto the real-time augmented reality picture, giving 
users an immersive and dynamic experience that allows them 
to seamlessly combine the virtual and real worlds[18]. Users 
are given the opportunity to explore the augmented world 
thanks to this potent capability, which also makes it possible 
for them to acquire contextual information in a thorough and 
interesting way. 
3) Integration, Rigorous Testing, and Expert Insights: 
An integrated system that demonstrates incredible potential 
is the result of the seamless integration of YOLOv5's detailed 
and excellent object detection precision and Three.js' 
immersive AR capabilities. In order to confirm the system's 
robustness and inherent adaptability across the spectrum of 
varying 
conditions 
encountered 
in 
real-world 
pest 
management scenarios, this integrated system goes through 
extensive and meticulous testing across a variety of diverse 
and complex scenarios. Additionally, seasoned agricultural 
professionals' unique ideas and criticism are extremely 
helpful in guiding iterative refinements, ensuring that the 
integrated system remains attuned to the subtle and intricate 
nuances of real-world pest management dynamics. 
In conclusion, this research is not merely an exploration of 
technological prowess; it is a testament to the transformative 
potential of symbiotic innovation. The seamless harmony 
between the precision-driven object detection capabilities of 
YOLOv5 and the immersive AR potentials of Three.js 
signifies a remarkable advancement in the realm of pest 
management within agriculture [21]. The implications are 
profound, promising a reimagined landscape of decision-
making that is bolstered by enhanced productivity, 
sustainability, and resilience within the critical domain of pest 
management. 
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. Evaluation of the Organic Crop Rotation System Using 
Precision Agriculture Data 
Upon deploying the Smart System for Organic Crop 
Rotation in the Nuwara Eliya district, several notable 
outcomes and implications emerged. 
1) System's Recommendations Validity:Upon evaluation, 
the recommendations provided by the system largely aligned 
with the expert advice and traditional knowledge of the 
region. This validation strengthens the system's credibility 
and emphasizes the importance of precision data in modern 
agriculture. 
2) NPK Discrepancies:In instances where farmers' soil 
NPK levels deviated from the ideal, the system's 
recommendations for organic fertilizers and interventions 
were consistent with best practices. This highlighted the 
system's ability to provide actionable insights based on 
precision data. As depicted in table 01 when standard levels 
for N,P,K differs then metnioned organic fetilizers will 
propse by system. 
TABLE I. FERTILIZER RECOMENDATION

Potassium (K) 
0.1-0.2% 
Wood ash 
 
3) Scalability Considerations:Given the success in 
Nuwara Eliya, discussions around expanding the system's 
rule base to include more districts have been initiated. This 
will necessitate additional collaborations with local 
agricultural experts from those districts. 
The integration of precision agricultural data into the 
decision-making process of organic crop rotation showcases 
promising potential. The system, with further refinements, 
could serve as a benchmark for other districts in Sri Lanka 
and potentially for similar agricultural settings worldwide. 
B. Crop Recommendation using real time soil data 
The Soil-Based Crop Recommendation Component 
yielded valuable insights, showcasing its potential for 
precision agriculture. This adaptability to changing soil 
conditions emphasizes the system's practicality. The 
algorithm accurately calculated the Crop Suitability Index 
(CSI) using real-time NPK sensor data and generated a 
dataset. Three machine learning models were considered for 
crop recommendation, Regression Model, Decision Tree 
Model, and Random Forest Model. Noticeably Random 
Forest Model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting 
optimal crops based on real-time NPK levels as shown in 
Fig.3.  
             The Regression Model operates by establishing 
relationships between the NPK levels and historical crop 
data. It generates a mathematical equation that captures the 
correlations between these variables. When presented with 
current NPK data, the Regression Model uses this equation to 
predict the most suitable crop based on its understanding of 
past 
associations. 
While 
this 
model 
provides 
a 
straightforward prediction, its accuracy is limited by its linear

nature and the assumption of a constant relationship between 
NPK levels. The Decision Tree Model, on the other hand, 
takes a more intricate approach. It constructs a decision tree 
which is a branching structure where each node represents a 
condition based on NPK levels, and each leaf node 
corresponds to a recommended crop. This model evaluates 
the NPK data by traversing the decision tree from the root 
node to a leaf node. At each branching point, it makes 
decisions based on the NPK values, ultimately arriving at a 
specific crop recommendation. The Random Forest Model 
enhances the recommendation process by aggregating the 
predictions of multiple decision trees. It creates an ensemble 
of decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the 
data. When new NPK data is presented, each individual tree 
in the ensemble provides its own recommendation. The 
Random 
Forest 
Model 
then 
combines 
these 
recommendations to arrive at a final crop recommendation. 
This ensemble approach improves prediction accuracy and 
robustness. Hence configuring the Crop Recommendation 
Component to the Smart System for Better Organic Crop 
Rotation, it highlighted how different parts of the system 
work together. Techniques that combine data made our 
decisions about crop rotation stronger. This whole Smart 
System, which uses real-time NPK data and machine 
learning, helps farmers make better decisions that take care 
of the environment. 
C. Crop suggession using real time weather data 
 
After collecting and analyzing the weather data 
using smart devices, we discovered some important things. 
We noticed that during hot and dry times, certain crops like 
tomatoes and peppers tend to do well. On the other hand, 
when it's rainy and a bit cooler, crops like lettuce and spinach 
seem to thrive. Additionally, it turned out that the weather 
forecasts were a good match for what transpired. As a result, 
farmers may find our smart device to be a beneficial planning 
tool [11]. For instance, if our device alerts them that the 
upcoming week will be bright, they might choose to grow 
crops that benefit from sunlight.

The average temperature, humidity, and recommended crops 
are all included in table 02 along with the weather data. 
Farmers can choose the best crop rotation practices by 
carefully weighing these elements in tandem. Even though 
our smart system recommendations typically come true, 
farmers should be adaptable because the weather might 
occasionally change unexpectedly. 
 
The unique aspect is that our technology does more 
than just provide weather information; it also makes 
agricultural planting recommendations [12] as shown in the 
fig.4. Farmers now have an easier time deciding what to 
cultivate and when. It's like having a helpful friend who is an 
expert on weather and farming. The forecasts we made 
weren't always accurate, though, as we discovered. Guessing 
the weather can be challenging, especially when it changes 
unexpectedly [13]. Because of this, even though our device is 
useful, it's still a good idea for farmers to keep an eye on the 
skies in case something happens. 
D. Pest detection with yolov5 and augmented reality 
 
The comprehensive assessment metrics covering 
recall, accuracy, precision, and F1 score like shown in the fig. 
5, provide a quantified look at the effectiveness of the React 
Native-YOLO augmented reality solution for pest overlay in 
real situations. 
The actual application highlights the smooth combination of 
YOLO's sophisticated pest detection skills, React Native's 
dynamic user interface, and augmented reality's immersive 
possibilities. This synthesis appears as a powerful tool to 
seamlessly incorporate digital pest markers into physical 
environments, enhancing in-the-moment interaction.

Beyond numerical quantities, the discussion's core 
issues are involved. According to figure5, digital pest 
indicators are integrated with the physical environment to 
create an augmented reality that adds richness to user 
experiences. The interactive aspect is highlighted; users 
actively interact with virtual overlays in their current context 
in addition to identifying them. This combination opens the 
door for a wide range of uses, from agricultural analyses to 
public health interventions. Additionally, the combination of 
these technologies resonates with a wider range of immersive 
and computer vision domains. The future is brighter with 
improved real-time detection, increased engagement, and a 
wider range of applications. 
V. CONCLUSION 
This research successfully introduced a Smart System for 
Optimized Organic Crop Rotation, harnessing the capabilities 
of the IoT, ML, and cloud computing to address prevalent 
challenges in organic farming. Through real-time soil health 
analytics and climate-sensitive data processing, would 
instrumental for farmers to make decisions about the exact 
time period of crop rotations in turns, save from pest attacks, 
and suggest remedies for diseases. Notably, the cloud 
computing-based model for pest and disease identification 
emerged as a pivotal tool, bridging traditional farming 
methodologies with modern technological solutions. By 
integrating these technological advancements with traditional 
agricultural practices, we believe our system not only 
optimizes organic farming but also propels the agricultural 
sector closer to its sustainability goals.
