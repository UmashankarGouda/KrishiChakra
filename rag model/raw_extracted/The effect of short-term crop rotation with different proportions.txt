Abstract
The article presents the results of the 2020‒2021 research carried out in the experimental ﬁ eld of 
Kharkiv National Agrarian University named after V. V. Dokuchaev, located in the area of the Left 
Bank Forest-Steppe of Ukraine. We aimed to ﬁ nd out whether the cellulosolytic activity of the soil 
depends on the increase in the proportion of sunﬂ ower in short-term crop rotations. The climate of 
the region is moderately continental with insuﬃ  cient and unstable level of hydration. The inﬂ uence 
of short-term crop rotations with different sunﬂ ower saturation on the degree of cellulosolithic ac-
tivity of the arable soil layer were studied. The study of the general cellulosolytic activity of the soil 
was carried out by the method that is based on the intensity of cellulose decomposition. Probably 
activity of cellulosolithic microorganisms depends not only on the weather and climatic conditions 
and certain agrophysical indicators of soil fertility, but also on the amount of plant remains left by 
the sunﬂ ower. The higher the percentage of saturation of crop rotation with sunﬂ ower is the higher 
is the intensity of the decomposition of the canvas. On average, over the years of research, the high-
est intensity of development of cellulose-destroying microorganisms (28.6%) in the arable soil layer 
(0‒30 cm) was in the ﬁ eld of ﬁ ve-ﬁ eld crop rotation, where the share of sunﬂ ower was 60%. Al-
though clean fallow contributes to the accumulation of moisture in the soil, practically the absence 
of plants does not ensure its cellulosolithic activity. Research showed that fallow and sunﬂ ower 
have different effects on soil moisture. The crop rotation ﬁ eld with 20% sunﬂ ower saturation in the 
0-30 cm layer of soil contained the maximum – 15.6% of moisture.

Introduction
Soil microorganisms play a key role in preserving and 
restoring soil fertility. This is due to the mineralization of or-
ganic material into available plant nutrients. Therefore, it is 
important to maintain a high microbiological activity in the 
soil (Volkohon, 2005; Yan et al., 2015). The direction and pace of 
transformation of organic material entering the soil are limited 
by the activity of soil microorganisms (Manzoni and Porporato, 
2009). It is precisely with this part of the soil biota where trans-
formations of organic compounds take place. (Shykula and De-
mydenko, 2000; Bastida et al., 2006; Stuart Chapin et al., 2009). 
Plant remains play an important role in improving the mor-
phological and genetic properties of chernozem. Their amount 
is directly related to the action of abiotic factors of the soil en-
vironment: temperature, moisture, nutrient availability (De-
mydenko, 2005). The period of biological activity of the soil can 
be extended due to the optimal agrophysical condition, pres-
ence of a layer of mulch on the soil surface and ideal perfect 
structure of the arable soil layer (0–30 cm). At the same time, 
the soil moisture should not be lower than the wilting moisture 
(Demydenko, 2013). This is especially important for the driest 
period of the year in Ukraine (July–August).
Cellulolytic activity is an indicator of soil biological activ-
ity (Iutynska, 2006; Varbanets and Borzova, 2010; Veum et al., 
2014). There are representatives of the genera Pseudomonas, 
Cytophaga, Sporocytophaga, Cellvibrio, Vibrio, Polyangium, 
Sporangium, as well as bacteria of Actinomycetaceae species 
and micromycetes among cellulose-destroying microorgan-
isms (Hatami et al., 2008; Vostrykova, 2012). Decomposing cel-
lulose, they secrete into the environment some enzymes that 
contribute to creation of humic substances and the formation 
of structural aggregates. The more intense this process is, the 
faster the cycle of elements occurs and the better the plant are 
provided with nutrients (Kurdysh, 2009; Gupta et al., 2012; 
Hepenko, 2013; Kovalov et al., 2015). Both anthropogenic and 
natural origin various factors influence soil microbial activity. 
(Lyko et al., 2017). Climate influence microbial communities by 
determining both temperature and humidity, which influence 
microbial communities and activities (Prescott et al., 2004;

Hackl et al., 2005; Fenoy et al., 2016). The available soil mois-
ture is important for the development of microorganisms.
The study of the cellulolytic activity of the soil makes it 
possible to understanding deeper and reveal regularities in 
the processes of organic matter transformation. At this an-
thropogenic impact on the soil and its properties are taken 
into account (Symochko, 2008). Crop rotation, precursors and 
technologies of growing crops including sunflower have a sig-
nificant influence on cellulolytic activity. As the intensity of 
microorganisms increases, the productivity of crops increases 
too, organic matter accumulates in the soil, and its physical and 
chemical properties and fertility improve as well (Zinchenko, 
2001; Boiko et al., 2005; Iutynska, 2006). 
Organic remains of plant origin are transformed in the 
soil under the influence of microorganisms. This ultimately 
leads to its humification and complete mineralization, with 
the formation of intermediate products that can have a physi-
ological effect on the next crop of rotation (Iutynska, 2006). 
Although soil microorganisms play a central role in the soil 
processes we are only beginning to understand how microbial 
communities are shaped by environmental factors (Brockett 
et al., 2012).
To date, the problem of the interrelationship between 
crops and soil microorganisms has been insufficiently studied. 
It becomes especially relevant due to changes in weather and 
climatic conditions and needs to be solved by crop rotation fac-
tors. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect on the 
cellulolytic activity of the soil of short-term crop rotations with 
different percentages of sunflower.
2. 
Materials and methods
Studies to determine the cellulolytic activity of the soil in 
sunflower crops were performed based on the chair of Farming 
named after O. M. Mozheiko of the experimental field of Kharkiv 
National Agrarian University named after V. V. Dokuchaev. De-
termining the intensity of decomposition of the canvas objec-
tively reflects the state and activity of the microbiota in specific 
soil and climatic conditions. The place of research is located in 
the eastern part of the Kharkiv region of Ukraine. The complex-
ity of the climatic conditions of the Kharkiv region of Ukraine 
for agriculture is also revealed in not existing guaranteed an-
nual sufficient moisture apart from it in certain years warm re-
sources are much lower than are needed for crops. According to 
the meteorological station of KhNAU, during the growing season 
of sunflower (May–September) the average long-term precipita-
tion is 278 mm, air temperature + 17.7°С. The peculiarity of the 
conditions for 2020–2021 research in the period of exposure of 
the canvas was insufficient moisture. During the vegetation pe-
riod of sunflower in 2020, precipitation was 114 mm less than 
normal, and the average air temperature was 19.8°C, which is 
2.1°C above the climatic norm. Atmospheric precipitation of the 
vegetation period of sunflower in 2021 had a torrential charac-
ter in June – 81.9 mm, which is 22.9 mm higher than the average 
long-term norm. In July and August, precipitation was lower by 
long-term averages of 51.5 and 44.2 mm, respectively. Precipita-
tion in 2021 was 197.7 mm, which is 81.3 mm less than the long-
term norm, and the excess of the average daily air temperature 
by 2.5°C compared to the perennial. Therefore, the vegetation of 
sunflowers in this period took place in relatively unfavorable 
conditions.
The soil cover of the experimental field is represented by 
typical chernozem heavy loam on loess-like loam (Chernozem 
Haplic). This soil is characterized by good physical and mechani-
cal, agrochemical, and some chemical properties, fairly high 
reserves of nutrients available to plants, high humus content, 
and intensive biological activity. The arable layer of the soil 
(0–30 cm) contains humus (according to Tyurin) – 4.9–5.1%, eas-
ily hydrolyzable nitrogen (according to Kornfield) – 81 mg/kg of 
soil, mobile forms of phosphorus and potassium (according to 
Chirikov) – 100 and 200 mg/kg of soil. Content of exchangeable 
cations: calcium – 37.8%, magnesium – 6.6%, sodium – 0.49%, po-
tassium – 0.5%, hydrogen – 21 mg-equiv./kg soil. The soil reaction 
‒ pH: aqueous – 7.0, salt – 5.2–5.6. Groundwater lies at a depth of 
about 18 m (Tykhonenko and Dehtiarov, 2016). Chernozem soils 
are characterized by a fairly high cellulolytic activity (70–80%) 
(Ellanska et al, 2008).
Variants of short-term (5-field) crop rotations with differ-
ent proportions of sunflower in the structure of the sown areas 
were studied (Table 1). Сontrol variant ‒ fallow.
Sunflower hybrid – Cruiser LG59580. The size of the sowing 
area is 750 m2, the accounting area is 100 m2. The technology of 
sunflower cultivation is generally accepted for the conditions of 
the Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine. After harvesting the precur-
sor, disking is carried out to a depth of 6–8 cm and plowing to 
a depth of 25–27 cm. In the spring, harrowing with heavy har-
rows, pre-sowing cultivation to a depth of 6–8 cm. For the main 
fertilization, nitrophosk is used at the rate of 400 kg/ha. Sunflow-
er is sown at a soil temperature of 8–10°С. The rate of sowing is 
50–55 thousand seeds per hectare. The depth of seed wrapping 
is 6–8 cm. The width of the rows is 70 cm. Protection of crops 
from weeds is carried out by cultivation and application of the 
herbicide Harness (2 l/ha). Harvesting was carried out by direct 
combining at a seed moisture content of 10–12% (Tishchenko et 
al., 2015).

Cellulolytic activity of typical chernozem
156097
Studies were performed by a method based on the inten-
sity of cellulosolytic decomposition. This gives a fairly accurate 
idea of the effect of sunflower cultivation in short-term crop 
rotations on the intensity of decomposition of plant residues in 
the soil (Béguin and Aubert, 1994; Lynd et al., 2002). To deter-
mine the intensity of cellulose decomposition, a flax tissue mea-
suring 10 cm was attached to the polymer film. The film was 
sterilized with alcohol and the tissue in an autoclave. A cut is 
made in the soil and a canvas is attached to its vertical wall. On 
the other hand, polyethylene is pressed by the soil. The canvas 
was laid every 10 cm to a depth of 30 cm. Fabric applications 
are left in the soil for 45 days. The experiment was repeated 
three times. After 45 days, the cloth is taken out, washed from 
the soil, dried, and weighed. The fact of decomposition of the 
canvas was determined by the loss of its initial mass. The for-
mula was used to determine cellulolytic activity based on mass 
loss (in percent):
ͳԟʹ
ͳ
έͳͲͲ 
Equation 1
where: m1 ‒ the starting mass, m2 ‒ the mass of the remaining 
fabric. To assess the cellulolytic activity of the soil used the scale: 
10% – very weak, 10–30 – weak, 30–50 – medium, 50–80 – strong, 
and over 80% – very strong.
Soil moisture was determined by the thermostatic weight 
method (Soil survey standard test method, 1994). The method is 
based on removing soil moisture by oven-drying a soil sample 
until the weight remains constant. The moisture content (%) 
is calculated from the sample weight before and after drying. 
The aluminum containers are weighed beforehand. Containers 
with soil samples are closed with a lid and weighed again with 
an accuracy of 0.1 g. Next, the open boxes together with the lid 
are placed in a drying cabinet and the soil is dried to a constant 
weight (at a temperature of 105°C). After drying, the containers 
are removed from the drying cabinet and weighed again, ob-
taining the value of the weight of completely dry soil.
The formula for calculating moisture:
ʛʠǡΨα ʹԟ͵
͵ԟͳ έͳͲͲ
 
Equation 2
where: W1 ‒ the weight of the container (g), W2 ‒ the weight 
of moist soil + container (g), and W3 ‒ the weight of dried soil + 
container (g).
The statistical assessment of the reliability of the differences 
in the measurement results was carried out using the least sig-
nificant difference (LSD0.95) by comparing the calculated Fisher 
criterion with the theoretical one. If the calculated criterion is 
greater than the theoretical one, it is possible to conclude the 
statistical reliability of the entire experiment.

Results and discussion
Studies of the cellulolytic activity of typical chernozem in 
2020 showed that the intensity of cellulose-destroying microor-
ganisms was very weak. In the process of estimating the inten-
sity of cellulose decomposition, the dependence of this process 
on the share of sunflower in crop rotation was revealed. The 
higher the percentage of crop rotation sunflower saturation 
is, the higher of the intensity of canvas decomposition. In plots 
with sunflower crops, there was an increase in cellulolytic activ-
ity of the soil in the layer of 10–20 cm by an average of 37% and 
20–30 cm by 59% compared to the surface layer of soil of 0–10 
cm (Table 2).
In the plot with 60% sunflower saturation, the highest activ-
ity of cellulose decomposition was observed in all soil layers. In 
the arable soil layer (0–30 cm) of this variant, the level of bio-
logical activity was 5.1%. Saturation of rotation with grain crops 
up to 60% and sunflower at 40% causes a decrease in cellulose 
decomposition activity. In the surface layer of the soil (0–10 cm) 
it was equal to 2.2%, 10–20 cm – 2.9%, and 20–30 cm – 4.1%. The 
use of rotation with a share of grain crops up to 80% and sun-
flower 20% negatively affected the intensity of decomposition of 
the canvas in all soil layers. Due to the favorable combination of 
moisture content in the soil in 2021 (compared to 2020) (Table 3) 
and the availability of sufficient reserves of energy material, the 
conditions for the activity of microorganisms in all research ar-
eas have significantly improved. The crop rotation areas with 
sunflower saturation from 20 up to 60% had an average inten-
sity of cellulose decomposition with increasing depth of the ar-
able layer. Higher cellulolytic activity of the soil was observed at 
saturation of crop rotations with sunflower up to 60%.
This indicator is the lowest in the control variant (Table 4). 
In the plot with clean fallow, the maximum cellulolytic activity 
of the soil (14.6%) was recorded in the lower (20–30 cm) layer, 
and in the layers 0–10 and 10–20 cm, this figure decreased to 
4.8 and 11.3%, respectively. The highest transformation of plant

residues (66.4%) was recorded in the soil layer of 20–30 cm in 
the area with crop rotation, where the share of sunflower is 
60%. For 45 days, the decrease in tissue weight to the initial in 
the soil layers 0–10 and 10–20 cm was: 43.3 and 46.5%. In the 
crop rotation field with 20% sunflower saturation, the intensity 
of cellulose decomposition was increased from very weak (4.8%) 
in the soil layer 0–10 cm, weak (11.3%) in the layer 10–20 cm to 
medium (53.1%) in the soil layer 20–30 cm. On average, over the 
years of research, the highest intensity of cellulolytic microor-
ganisms in the arable soil layer (0–30 cm) occurred in the field of 
five-year crop rotation, where the share of sunflower was 60% 
(28.6%) (Fig. 1). Crop rotations with sunflower saturation of 20 
and 40% had a slightly smaller effect on the intensity of cellulose 
decomposition: 13.3 and 23.6%. The lowest figure was in crop 
rotation with fallow (6.2%), which can be explained by the low 
amount of crop residues.
The obtained data coincide with the conclusions of Hepenko 
(2013), that crop rotations with row crops, which leave behind 
coarse residues (including sunflower) and slowly decompose 
provide a high intensity of cellulose decomposition (15.8%). The

lowest cellulolytic activity is revealed in crop rotation with clean 
fallow (9.4%). In the studies of Kaziuta and Yaremenko (2020), it 
was shown that cellulose-destroying activity decreases with in-
creasing depth, and this contradicts our data. The maximum cel-
lulose activity (18%) of chernozem under sunflower is revealed 
in a layer of 0–10 cm. Deeper, this figure decreases two or more 
times, and cellulose activity is assessed as very weak.
As mentioned above, moisture reserves play an important 
role in the cellulolytic activity of the soil. Studies have shown 
that clean fallow and sunflower have different effects on soil 
moisture (Fig. 2). The crop rotation field with 20% sunflower 
saturation in the 0–30 cm layer of soil contains a maximum of 
– 15.6% of moisture. A slightly worse result was observed in 
a field with clean fallow. In this variant, the arable soil layer 
was provided with moisture at the level of 15.1%. In the 30-cen-
timeter layer of soil, the least moisture was left after sunflow-
er with a saturation of crop rotation of 40 and 60%: 14.9 and 
13.9% respectively. This is because weather conditions (high 
air temperature and lack of precipitation) cause severe drying 
of the soil under this crop.
These results are confirmed by data from other research-
ers. In the case when sunflower occupies 50% of the crop rota-
tion area, the moisture content of the soil layer 0–150 cm is the 
lowest – 1203 m3/ha. With a decrease in the share of sunflower 
from 50.0 to 33.3, 25.0, 20.0, and 14.3% there is an increase in 
the accumulation of precipitation in the soil, in general on crop 
rotations, by 47, 49, 42 and 58 m3/ha (Hanhur, 2019). The ac-
tivity of soil microbiota is directly proportional to the condi-
tions of moisture in the arable layer (0–30 cm) of soil. There 
is a tendency to reduce the decomposition of linen fabric with 
the deterioration of the intra-soil microclimate. This is due to 
arid conditions with progressive dehydration and compaction 
of the arable layer of typical chernozem (Tsyliuryk et al., 2017; 
Tsentylo, 2019). 
So, the main principle of creation crop rotations is scien-
tifically based placement and rotation of field crops. Previous 
research showed that having a higher diversity of crops in 
a rotation might increase crop productivity through ecological 
stability and soil resilience (Gaudin et al., 2015; Woźniak and 
Soroka, 2018). Modern realities are such that the constant cul-
tivation of sunflower in crop rotation is quite often practiced. 
Most farms abandon the scientifically based technologies of 
their cultivation for the sake of profit maximization. Nowadays, 
on most farms, it returns to its previous place after 2‒3 years. 
Mono-cropping exosts soil nutrients and reduces of coefficient 
nutrient utilization and microbial resistance to environmental 
changes (Lithourgidis et al., 2006; McDaniel et al., 2014; Li et al., 
2019). Studies show that the use of disease-resistant varieties 
and hybrids can come back the return period of sunflower to 
five years (Lebid, 2006). 
Crop rotation is a major cropping management system used 
in agroecosystems. Crop rotation is effective due to the improved 
richness of residual roots and litter in cropping soils which may 
improve crop yields (Smith et al., 2008). Crop rotations increase 
soil fertility and tend to promote microbial diversity, and it has 
been hypothesized that crop rotations can enhance disease sup-
pressive capacity, either through the influence of plant diversity 
impacting soil bacterial composition or through the increased 
abundance of disease suppressive microorganisms (Peralta et 
al., 2018).
Increasing dependence on a small number of crops, such as 
sunflower, is leading to reductions in agricultural biodiversity 
(McDaniel et al., 2014). Plant-microbe interactions are not only 
crucial for a better understanding of plant growth and health 
but also for sustainable agriculture and environmental protec-
tion (Philippot et al., 2013).
The decomposition of cellulose is significantly influenced 
by hydrothermal conditions, soil structure, the chemical com-

position of organic material, and other factors. Soil moisture 
has a significant impact on the growth and development of 
crops (Adl, 2003), as well as on the biological activity of the soil 
(Paul et al., 2003). The temperature of 30°C and moisture of 
80–90% out of the total moisture content are the optimal con-
ditions for the mineralization of plant residues (Sozinov and 
Prister, 1994). Excessive moisture content in the soil leads to 
increased activity of microorganisms (Kozlowski, 1984; Skopp 
et al., 1990), and lack of reduces it (Bottner, 1985; Kieft et al., 
1987). Temperature is important for the intensity of microbiota 
development (Snitynskyi et al., 2014). At low temperatures and 
moisture, the biological decomposition of the substrate slows 
down, increasing temperature and moisture stimulates its in-
creage. However, high moisture at a favorable temperature 
can inhibit the aerobic direction of its development (Sozinov 
and Prister, 1994). At sufficient moisture, but low temperature, 
the destruction of organic residues also slows down. Significant 
fluctuations of soil temperature activate the mineralization 
processes, as the physicochemical properties of water-soluble 
organic substances change increase (Sozinov and Prister, 1994; 
Voroney, 2007). The high dependence of cellulolytic activity 
on weather and climatic conditions is confirmed by correla-
tion analysis (r=0.76) (Prescott et al., 2004; Kovalov et al., 2015). 
Soil moisture drastically negatively highly is correlated with 
the variation in amount of microbial which degrade cellulose. 
Hackl et al. (2005) also found that soil moisture was an impor-
tant factor of overall microbial activity.
It has been noted in some studies that microorganisms 
destroy cellulose when moisture is low (Bardgett, 2005). De-
creased activity of cellulose-destroying microorganisms is as-
sociated with adverse conditions, including high temperatures 
and low soil moisture. The process of cellulose decomposition 
is closely related to the biological activity of the soil (Karaca 
et al., 2010; Stuart Chapin et al., 2009). In this regard, the task 
of further study of the interrelation between the saturation of 
short-term crop rotations with sunflower, moisture, and inten-
sity of microbiological processes in the soil remains actual.

Conclusions
According to the indicator of the cellulolytic activity of 
the soil, the possibility of increasing the share of sunflower 
in short-term crop rotations has been established. Conditions 
of insufficient soil moisture do not contribute strong cellulose 
activity. Growing sunflower with an increase in sown area 
in crop rotation causes the accumulation of coarse residues, 
thereby increasing the cellulose activity of the soil. At this, the 
optimal water regime is created by pure steam and sunflower 
with a share in crop rotation of 20%. However, the cellulose 
activity of the soil in the field under fallow is low due to the 
insufficient amount of plant residues, which are used by the 
microbiome as a nutrient and energy material. Reducing the 
amount of precipitation negatively affects the intensity of cel-
lulose decomposition in the surface layers of the soil (0–10 
cm) and contributes to its high activity in the deeper layers
