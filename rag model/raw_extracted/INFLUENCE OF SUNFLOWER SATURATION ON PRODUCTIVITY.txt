Abstract 
 
The place of sunflower in crop rotation is determined by its special requirements for the frequency of return to the 
previous place of cultivation. Without this requirement, there are insufficient guarantees to obtain a high yield of this 
crop. For efficient sunflower cultivation, crop rotations with a small set of crops and a short rotation period are 
recommended. Studies on the possibility of increasing the share of sunflower in crop rotations of short-term crop 
rotations and determining the impact on the productivity of the entire crop rotation were conducted in the Left Bank 
Forest-Steppe of Ukraine. It is established that increasing the saturation of sunflower in crop rotation leads to a 
decrease in its yield and productivity of the entire crop rotation. 
 
Key words: sunflower, short-term crop rotations, yield, productivity. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
It is known that crop rotations are the basis 
system of farming (Boiko et al., 2014; 
Kaminskyi & Boiko, 2013). They are being 
developed in compliance with the norms of 
alternation in rotation, adaptability of crops to 
specific soil and climatic conditions and 
specialization of the economy (Boiko et al., 
2007; Boiko, & Kovalenko, 2008). Rational 
crop rotations provide conditions for the 
systematic application of technologies in each 
field, increasing soil fertility and productivity 
of each crop and, accordingly, the productivity 
of crop rotation itself. The level of productivity 
of crops that are part of crop rotation is the 
result of all technological measures of their 
cultivation (Dorozhko et al., 2011). The higher 
the impact of predecessors, tillage systems, 
organic and mineral fertilizers, plant protection 
products and plant growth regulators, the 
higher the level of yield of each individual crop 
and crop rotation productivity in general 
(Boiko & Kovalenko, 2003; Brazhenko & 
Brazhenko, 2005). Thus, productivity can be 
considered one of the main indicators that 
characterizes the adaptation of crop rotations to 
specific soil and climatic conditions (Ryzhuk et 
al., 2002; Litvinov & Tovstenko, 2010). This is 
especially 
true 
at 
present, 
when 
most 
agricultural 
formations 
have 
a 
narrow 
production direction, which necessitates the 
widespread introduction of crop rotations with 
a short period. 
Productivity of crop rotations depends on 
different saturation, ratio and location of crops. 
Modern market conditions of production in 
Ukraine require such a placement of crops that 
would meet the needs, lead to increased 
productivity of crops, contribute to the 
stabilization of soil fertility (Kovalenko, 2014; 
Litvinov, 2015; Yurkevych et al., 2011) and 
ecological balance of the environment (Shuvar, 
1998). In modern agriculture of Ukraine new 
agricultural enterprises with different areas of 
land tenure, land use and areas of specialization 
have been created. In this regard, there is a 
need to develop and improve the optimal forms 
of organization of the territory and innovation 
of short-term crop rotations with the optimal 
combination 
of 
different 
levels 
of 
intensification (Boiko et al., 2012; Dehodiuk & 
Boiko, 2008; Lebid, 2006; Saiko, 2002; 
Kaminskyi, 2012; Cherenkov et al., 2012). 
Sunflower is the main oil crop of Ukraine. In 
recent years, there has been increased demand 
(in the domestic market and abroad) for 
sunflower seeds and products of its processing. 
Growing 
sunflowers 
has 
become 
quite 
profitable due to rising prices for its products. 
This is an important incentive to increase the 
area under this strategic crop in the forest-
steppe zone of Ukraine. The high potential 
productivity of modern sunflower hybrids is

not fully realized in production conditions. This 
is due to insufficient supply of nutrients to the 
soil. In some regions of Ukraine, sunflower is 
an unalterable crop for most producers. They 
return this culture every 2-3 years. In the 
northern part of the Steppe and Forest-Steppe 
zone, farmers manage to return sunflower to its 
previous place in 4-5 years (Beliakov et al., 
2008; Boiko & Borodan, 2000; Boiko et al., 
2005). 
There is no unequivocal opinion among 
scientists and producers about the maximum 
saturation of crop rotations with sunflower. The 
vast majority of scientists who touch on this 
problem believe that sunflowers should return 
to their previous location no more than 8-10 
years later (Dolgova, 1986; Inshin, 1985). At 
the same time, some scientists argue that this 
interval may be shorter (Lebid & Boiko, 2000; 
Pastushenko, 1972). Of great importance is the 
correct location in the crop rotation of 
sunflower. When developing crop rotations 
with this crop, the minimum allowable return 
period should be considered. However, in the 
literature, the authors estimate this interval 
differently, it ranges from 5 to 10 years (Boiko 
et al., 2005). 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Field research to determine the effect of 
saturation of short-term crop rotations with 
sunflower was conducted on the basis of the 
chair 
of 
agriculture 
named 
after 
O. M. Mozheiko of the research field of 
KhNAU named after V. V. Dokuchaev. This 
place is located in the eastern part of the 
Kharkiv district of the Kharkiv region of the 
territory of Ukraine. The soil cover of the 
experimental field is represented by typical 
chernozem heavy loam on loess-like loam. This 
soil 
is 
characterized 
by 
good 
physico-
mechanical, 
agrochemical 
and 
physico-
chemical properties, fairly high reserves of 
nutrients available to plants, high humus 
content and intensive biological activity 
(Tykhonenko & Dehtiarov, 2016). 
Scheme of experiment and alternation of crops

Forest-Steppe of Ukraine:

Sunflower hybrid - Cruiser LG59580. 
In the conditions of Richland Invest Limited 
Liability Company (LLC) of Balakliia district 
of Kharkiv region the productivity of four-field 
crop rotation with grain crops saturation by 
75%, sunflower by 25% was studied: winter 
wheat - corn - spring barley - sunflower, which 
is based on three tillage systems: traditional, 
minni-till, strip-till. In this territory of Ukraine, 
the soil cover is represented by ordinary 
chernozem. Repetition in the experiment is four 
times, the placement of plots is consistent. The 
sown area is 1800 m2, the total area of the 
experiment is 12.8 ha. 
Agrometeorological conditions for growing 
field crops, including wintering conditions, 
have changed along with climatic changes. 
Despite a certain increase in precipitation, the 
snow cover became unstable. Significant 
temperature fluctuations - from abnormally 
high to abnormally low - cause abiotic stress of 
plants. Sometimes the mild, warm nature of 
winter contributes to the intensification of pests 
and diseases of crops (Tsykov, 1984; Shapoval 
et al., 2008). Therefore, it is now important to 
assess the impact of sunflower depending on its 
location in short-term crop rotations on 
productivity and gross harvest of crops. 
According to the KhNAU meteorological post, 
the average annual rainfall is 529 mm, the ave-
rage annual air temperature is +7.2°С. Analy-
zing the weather conditions for 2020-2021, we 
can conclude that the indicators of heat and 
moisture significantly affected the length of the 
sunflower growing season, its growth and 
development, and ultimately the yield of 
sunflower and seed quality. In 2020-2021, the 
amount of precipitation during the sunflower 
growing season was 208.2 mm, which is 
70.8 mm lower than the long-term data.

Richland Invest LLC is located in the territory 
of insufficient humidification of the Northern 
Steppe of Ukraine. During the study period, 
there was a significant deviation of the average 
daily temperature and rainfall from the average 
long-term values. The temperature regime 
confirms the trend of warming in the Northern 
Steppe of Ukraine. The largest deviations of air 
temperature from the average long-term 
indicators were observed in the spring and 
summer. There was an acute shortage of 
moisture throughout the growing season. In 
general, compared to long-term indicators, the 
decrease in precipitation at this time was 
66.3 mm or about 24%. During the years of 
research, there were drought periods, which 
had a negative impact on the conditions of 
growing crops. 
Comparative assessment of the productivity of 
short-term crop rotations in studies was 
calculated by the volume of production per 1 ha 
of crop rotation area, which was converted into 
feed and feed protein units and digestible 
protein (Grevtcov, 1991). By-products were not 
taken into account in determining these 
indicators. 
To find out the possibility of scientifically 
substantiated expansion of sunflower crops and 
to determine the impact on the productivity of 
the crop itself and other crops in field crop 
rotations. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
There are many factors that determine the 
efficiency of agriculture, and crop rotation is 
one of the most important. With the increase in 
the diversity of cultivated crops, the efficiency 
of crop rotation increases. The leading factor in 
the high productivity of crops is their 
placement after the best predecessors in 
compliance with the norms of rotation. Highly 
productive are short-term rotation grain, grain-
row, grain-fallow-row, row, fodder with a wide 
range of grain saturation - from 33.3-50.0-
66.3% to 70-80-100%. In particular, cereals, 
row crops, legumes (pea, soy), as well as 
annual herbs (oats) and perennial legumes 
(sainfoin, clover, alfalfa). Realization of all the 
advantages of proper crop rotation increases 
crop yields, reduces the density of weeds, 
diseases, pests and reduces the cost of their 
control, ensures environmental balance, soil 
protection. Trends in the biologization of 
agriculture are intensifying in the world, 
starting 
with 
the 
improvement 
of 
crop 
rotations, which include grasses, legumes (pea, 
soy), intermediate and green crops, use non-
commodity 
(by-products) 
of 
crops 
and 
increased doses of organic fertilizers. There is a 
direct relationship between the length of 
rotation of crop rotations and productivity of 
crops: with decreasing length of rotation, their 
productivity decreases. 
According to the obtained results, the most 
promising option is crop rotation with a share 
of 20% vapors, grain crops - 50 (including food 
group from 20 to 40%) and industrial crops - 
30% (including 10% of sunflower). There is an 
opinion that in the structure of field crop 
rotation it is necessary to reduce the share of 
sunflower to the level of scientifically sound 
standards. This is possible by replacing part of 
its sown area with corn and rapeseed 
(respectively 10 and 20%), which will expand 
the group of profitable industrial crops in short-
rotation crop rotations to 30% (Shevchenko et 
al., 2015). 
All types of field short-term crop rotations are 
rational. With the observance of the technology 
of growing field crops in such crop rotations 
the yield of pea is provided - 4.05-4.28 t/ha, 
winter wheat - 5.16-6.63, winter rye - 5.49–
5.69, corn grain - 7.48-8.88, spring barley - 
5.03-5.78, sunflower - 4.14-4.26, rape - 3.59, 
corn for green fodder - 43.82-44.82, hay of 
perennial grasses - 6.60 t/ha. Estimation of the 
total productivity of short-term crop rotations 
shows that the yield of grain crops in crop 
rotations is in the range of 4.61-6.15 t/ha, and 
the harvest from 1 ha of arable land was: grain 
- 
3.00-6.00, 
fodder 
units 
- 
6.73-11.18, 
digestible protein - 0.60-1.08 t/ha (Kokhan et 
al., 2015). 
Kokhan et al. (2015) determined the highest 
yield of sunflower (2.82 t/ha) in the seven-field 
crop rotation, where its share was 14.3%. At 
saturation of crop rotation with sunflower to 
20%, 25%, 33.3%, 50% its productivity 
gradually decreases. Particularly sharp decline 
occurred in the two-field crop rotation - by 
0.54 t/ha and the three-field crop rotation - by 
0.28 t/ha. In seven-field, five-field and four-
field crop rotations with a share of sunflower, 
277
  
  
respectively 14.3%, 20% and 25%, the yield of 
sunflower fluctuated slightly - 2.82-2.67 t/ha. 
The increase in the sown area under sunflower 
in crop rotations does not affect the yield of 
other field crops, in particular corn, winter 
wheat, pea. Regardless of the degree of 
saturation of crop rotations with sunflower, the 
difference in yield does not exceed 0.29 t/ha, or 
4.6%.To some extent, this also applies to 
winter wheat. Its yield in crop rotations with a 
share of sunflower from 14.3% to 33.3% at the 
level of 4.59-4.65 t/ha. Crop rotation differs 
little in terms of pea yield - 1.76-1.89 t/ha. 
Only in the five-field crop rotation, where the 
share of sunflower is 20% and the predecessor 
is spring barley, pea grains were harvested by 
0.023 t/ha or 13% more. If you place crops in 
crop rotations after the best predecessors and 
adhere to their alternation, you can ensure high 
yields of winter wheat - 4.0-6.17 t/ha, spring 
wheat - 3.1-4.0 t/ha, spring barley - 3, 4-
5.48 t/ha, oats - 3.26-4.8 t/ha, pea - 3.2-4.2 t/ha, 
corn for grain - 7.38-10.0 t/ha, sugar beet 
roots - 43.0-67.2 t/ha, sunflower seeds - 2.46-
3.82 t/ha, green mass of annual and perennial 
grasses - 24.7-48.0 and 28.3-54.8 t/ha, green 
mass of winter green manure - 45.8-52.0 t/ha 
(Boiko et al., 2015). 
To increase the overall productivity of crop 
rotations, tillage is also of great importance. 
Today's conditions require a rational self-
healing 
system 
of 
agriculture 
with 
the 
involvement of non-traditional sources of 
mineral nutrition of plants and the use of 
moderate doses of fertilizers. This is possible in 
combination with the post-harvest residues of 
the predecessor for the expanded reproduction 
of fertility and restoration of natural soil 
formation of chernozems in agrocenoses. The 
distribution of crop residues on the field 
surface is regulated primarily by improving the 
methods of basic tillage, which are the 
foundation of any technology for growing field 
crops in different farming systems (Saiko & 
Maliienko, 2007). 
In the conditions of Research Enterprise 
«Research Economy» (RE«RE») «Dnipro» of 
the Institute of Agriculture of the steppe zone 
(Dnipropetrovsk region) it was found that in 
the three-field crop rotations the highest 
productivity (grain yield, sunflower seeds, 
grain and feed units, digestible protein) 
depends primarily on recruitment and yields of 
field crops in crop rotations. This indicator is 
determined 
by 
the 
combined 
effect 
of 
environmental factors, as well as technological 
features and differences of different tillage 
systems. It was found that in grain-fallow-row 
crop rotation with sunflower field, productivity 
indicators do not depend on the cultivation 
system. However, there may be an increase in 
grain yield - by 0.06 t/ha and grain yield - by 
0.02 t/ha of crop rotation area due to the 
shallow (subsoil tillage) system compared to 
the ploughing. Replacement of sunflower in 
crop rotation with spring barley leads to a 
decrease in crop rotation productivity in 
general by 2.9-5.9%, as well as to a decrease in 
the efficiency subsoil tillage system compared 
to the ploughing (Lebid & Tsyliuryk, 2014). It 
is proved that ploughing and differentiated 
tillage do not have a significant impact on crop 
rotation productivity. But with ploughing and 
disk plowing, compared with ploughing, it is 
significantly reduced (Prymak et al., 2018). 
Analyzing the data obtained in the period 2020-
2021, it is seen that the correct alternation of 
crops improves the conditions of growth and 
development of plants, which in turn affects the 
level of yield. Winter wheat was the most 
sensitive to the increase in the sown area of 
sunflower in crop rotation. Crop rotations, in 
which the share of sunflower was 20 and 40% 
provided the maximum level of winter wheat 
yield: 5.83 (Figure 1) and 5.54 t/ha (Figure 2), 
respectively.

Figure 2. Yield of crops depending on the share of

Winter wheat reacted negatively to increasing 
the saturation of crop rotation with sunflower 
up to 60%. In such crop rotation, the yield of 
this crop was reduced by 1.02-0.73 t/ha (Figure 
3). The yield of winter rye also depended on 
the share of sunflower in crop rotation. The 
yield of this crop varied from 3.13 t/ha to 2.70 
t/ha. In the crop rotation with a share of 
sunflower of 20% among the predecessors of 
winter rye, corn had an advantage, after which 
the yield was 3.13 t/ha. Placement after 
sunflower in crop rotations with shares of 40 
and 60% led to a decrease in winter rye yield 
by 0.29 and 0.43 t/ha. 
 
Figure 3. Yield of crops depending on the share of sunflower 60% in crop rotation 
 
The highest yield of sunflower (3.57 t/ha) was 
obtained in the five-field crop rotation, where 
its share was 40%. At saturation of crop 
rotation with sunflower up to 20% there was a 
slight decrease in its yield by 0.14 t/ha. 
Saturation of crop rotation with sunflower up to 
60% led to a significant reduction in its yield - 
3.21 t/ha. 
The highest yield of grain crops was obtained 
in the five-field crop rotation with grain 
saturation by 80% and sunflower by 20% -  
3.75 t/ha. In this crop rotation, the food output 
per hectare of forage and fodder protein units 
was 3.37 and 4.56 t/ha, digestible protein -  
0.52 t/ha (Table 1). In this variant, the 
dependence of the total productivity of crop 
rotation on the cultivation of corn in it, where it 
was: fooder - 0.73 and fodder protein units - 
2.01 t/ha, digestible protein - 0.04 t/ha. When 
replacing corn with sunflower, the yield of 
grain crops was 3.53 t/ha, which is 0.22 t/ha 
less than the previous version.At the same time, 
to gather from 1 ha of crop rotation area 
increased by 0.21 t fooder and 0.67 t fooder 
protein units, digestible protein by 0.17 t. 
When using the five-course crop rotation, where 
sunflower was grown for two years, the yield 
of fodder units was the highest (3.58 t/ha). The 
option with 60% sunflower saturation provided 
a lower yield of fooder units in crop rotation by 
0.23 t/ha. In the short crop rotation with 40% 
grain crops saturation and 60% sunflower, the 
yield of the first was 3.76 t/ha, and the yield of 
fooder units was 3.35 t/ha, digestible protein - 
0.75 and fooder protein units - 5.45 t/ha. The 
best precursor for winter wheat is peas. In the 
first variant of crop rotation after this 
predecessor, the total productivity of winter 
wheat was the highest and amounted to 7.00; 
7.87 and 0.87 t/ha of fooder, fooder protein 
units and digestible protein, respectively. 
Saturation of crop rotation with sunflower by 
40% reduced the productivity of winter wheat, 
which was placed after peas by 0.36 t/ha fooder 
units, digestible protein by 0.05 t/ha and 0.40 
t/ha fooder protein units. Growing sunflower as 
the first crop in crop rotation ensured the 
productivity of winter wheat at the level of 
5.77 t/ha of fodder units, 0.72 t/ha of digestible 
protein and 6.49 t/ha of fodder protein units.

Proper placement of pea in short crop rotations 
is of particular importance. It helps to improve 
the physical properties of the soil, reduce 
weediness. In 2020-2021, the yield of pea grain 
depended on the saturation of crop rotations 
with sunflower and ranged from 2.59 to 
2.80 t/ha. In two variants of crop rotation, pea 
were grown after its worst predecessor - 
sunflower. The high level of productivity of 
this leguminous crop was manifested in the 
five-field crop rotation, where sunflower was 
grown one year. In this embodiment, the yield 
of fooder units of pea was 2.80 t/ha, digestible 
protein - 0.47 and 3.73 t/ha of fooder protein 
units. A slight decrease in the total productivity 
of pea (by 0.21, 0.04 and 0.27 t/ha) occurred 
during its cultivation in crop rotation with a 
share of sunflower 40%. 
Over the years of research, the dependence of 
winter rye productivity on the saturation of 
short-term crop rotations with sunflower has 
been observed. Crops of winter rye in crop 
rotation with a share of sunflower 20% 
provided the largest collection of fooder, 
fooder protein units and digestible protein: 
3.69, 0.26 and 3.16 t/ha. In the second variant, 
the yield of fooder units per 1 ha was 3.35 t, 
digestible protein - 0.24 t and fooder protein 
units - 2.86 t. The negative impact of increasing 
the saturation of crop rotation with sunflower 
to 60% on the total productivity of winter rye 
was revealed: 3.18 t fooder units, 0.22 t 
digestible protein and 2.72 t fooder protein 
units. 
The overall productivity of sunflower depended 
largely on its yield. Placement of sunflower in 
the chain wheat - peas - winter wheat - 
sunflower - winter rye - sunflower contributed 
to the formation of the highest productivity: 
fooder units - 2.72, fooder protein - 6.30, 
digestible protein - 0.99 t/ha. 
Not the last place in the formation of the 
productivity of short-term crop rotations is 
given to tillage systems. In the four-year crop 
rotation, the highest productivity indicators 
(yield of fooder units, digestible protein and 
fooder protein units) depended on sunflower 
saturation, yield of field crops and tillage 
systems (Table 2).

The productivity of Strip-till technology at 27-
30 cm and plowing to a depth of 25-27 cm 
were equivalent: digestible protein yield - 0.52 
t/ha, fooder units (3.99-3.98 t/ha), fooder 
protein units (5.02-5.04 t/ha). The Minni-till 
system had the advantage over all productivity 
indicators due to better loosening, thorough 
mixing of the soil and crop residues to a depth 
of 30 cm. The use of the combined assembly 
TopDown, 25-27 cm increased the productivity 
of crop rotation in terms of feed yield - 4.13 
t/ha and forage protein units - 5.19 t/ha of crop 
rotation area. The tillage technologies under 
study ensured the yield of digestible protein in 
the range of 0.52-0.53 t/ha. Therefore, in short-
term crop rotations (at least four fields) it is 
possible to place sunflower of modern varieties 
and hybrids under conditions of high level of 
agricultural technology. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
It is proved that increasing the share of 
sunflower in short-term crop rotations leads to 
a decrease in the yield of the crop by 0.22-
0.36 t/ha. The yield of sunflower seeds is at the 
same level with a saturation of 20% and 40% 
(3.43 and 3.57 t/ha). In the zone of unstable 
moisture of the Left-Bank Forest-Steppe the 
most productive were short-term crop rotations 
with sunflower saturation of 40 and 60%. The 
increase in the share of sunflower in crop 
rotations is negatively reflected in the yield of 
cereals. But this oil crop provides a high yield 
of fooder protein units (5.23-5.45 t/ha) and 
digestible protein (0.69-0.75 t/ha). In order to 
increase the productivity of short-term crop 
rotations, it is necessary to take into account 
the tillage system. The productivity of crop 
rotation with a share of sunflower of 25% was 
best influenced by the system of surface tillage 
using the TopDown assembly to a depth of 25-
27 cm. In this crop rotation, the yield of feed 
and feed protein units was: 4.13 and 5.19 t/ha.
