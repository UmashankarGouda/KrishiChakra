Today’s agricultural production is heavily dependent on synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer. Its energy-intensive 
production and use are associated with a number of environmental burdens, such as global warming and ma­
rine eutrophication. Furthermore, fertilizer prices are subject to high volatility and have been rising steadily for 
years. One strategy to reduce the dependence on synthetic N fertilizer is to include legumes in the crop rotation, 
but it is important that this practice is economically viable to be adopted by farmers. Through gross margin 
analysis and life cycle assessment (LCA), we quantified the economic and environmental impacts of introducing 
grain legumes into rainfed bread wheat rotations in northern Spain. The analysis covered the full two-year se­
quences of barley-wheat, rapeseed-wheat and vetch-wheat. We further investigated the effect of four different 
bread wheat genotypes on the environmental and economic performance. In this case study, replacing synthetic 
N fertilizer with legume-fixed N in a two-year cropping rotation decreased most of the analysed environmental 
impacts. Modelled greenhouse gas emissions were 24 % lower for vetch-wheat compared to barley-wheat and 
11 % lower compared to rapeseed-wheat. Despite higher wheat yield, the vetch-wheat rotation had an 18 % 
lower gross margin than the rapeseed rotation and a 1 % higher gross margin than the barley rotation. The 
sensitivity analysis showed that only when fertilizer and wheat grain prices were more than doubled, that the 
legume rotation became more profitable than the other rotations. Consequently, farmers would require a 
financial incentive to include legumes in crop rotations and reduce environmental impacts.   
1. Introduction 
On a global scale, the agricultural sector is a significant contributor 
to anthropogenic global warming. Driven by population and economic 
growth, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture are projected 
to increase further (Mohammed et al., 2019). Developing mitigation 
strategies is crucial, but it is equally important that these practices are 
economically viable and adopted by farmers. One strategy is to reduce 
the use of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer, as it causes emissions of 
carbon dioxide (CO2) via the energy-intensive production process and of 
nitrous oxide (N2O) via application (Smith et al., 2008). However, 
climate change is not the only risk, as N fertilizer flows exceed the 
so-called planetary boundaries (Steffen et al., 2015). Synthetic N fer­
tilizer application is also a major source of ammonia (NH3) emissions 
that have significant environmental impacts such as eutrophication and 
acidification (Xu et al., 2019), and may cause surface and ground-water 
pollution by nitrates (Quemada et al., 2013). Improving the efficiency 
and/or reducing synthetic N fertilizer inputs would therefore, poten­
tially reduce both pre-farm CO2 emissions from fertilizer production and 
on-farm emissions from the application (e.g. N2O, NH3, NO3
- ). 
Several studies across different climate zones indicate that incorpo­
rating grain legumes into crop rotations can decrease N fertilizer

requirements during both the legume production year and in the sub­
sequent year, reducing the environmental impact of these production 
systems (Barton et al., 2014; Brock et al., 2016; Costa et al., 2021; 
MacWilliam et al., 2014). However, it is crucial that the subsequent crop 
efficiently uses the N introduced into the soil by the atmospheric bio­
logical fixation of the legumes (Quemada et al., 2020). In this context, 
genetic variation in the ability to use this legacy N is the focus of studies 
on bread wheat in Egypt and central Spain. Noureldin et al. (2013) found 
genotypic differences in N uptake and utilization efficiency under 
different N fertilizer levels. The same applies to Raya-Sereno et al. 
(2023) who compared genotypes with a different root architecture and 
their response to varying N fertilizer levels and pre-crops. However, 
these studies were purely agronomic, and most studies that focus on 
environmental impacts did not include different genotypes in their 
assessment. Using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, we explored 
the potential of combining reduced N fertilizer inputs using a legume 
pre-crop and genetic diversity to improve N uptake and utilization 
efficiency. 
The strategy of reducing synthetic N fertilizer inputs is attractive not 
only from an environmental point of view but also to reduce costs and 
exposure to price fluctuations for the farmer. Fertilizer prices are subject 
to high fluctuations and have been rising steadily for years. High energy 
prices, strong demand and limited supply, caused the price of urea 
ammonium nitrate (UAN) to increase fivefold between January 2021 
and March 2022 (Hebebrand and Laborde, 2022; Trading Economics, 
2022). As a result, we included an economic evaluation in this study and 
performed a sensitivity analysis with varying fertilizer and grain prices, 
given the high price uncertainty. In addition, we repeated the sensitivity 
analysis with a premium and discount for the grain protein content in 
order to take a qualitative aspect into account. A protein premium or 
discount is common for bread wheat, but varies greatly depending on 
the region. 
The specific objective of this study was to quantify the economic and 
environmental impacts of introducing grain legumes into rainfed bread 
wheat rotations in northern Spain. The analysis covered the 2-year se­
quences of barley-wheat, rapeseed-wheat and vetch-wheat. Using gross 
margin analysis and LCA, we aimed to answer the following research 
questions for this study: (i) Does incorporating legumes into a crop 
rotation cost-effectively reduce the environmental impact of bread 
wheat production through reduced N fertilizer input? (ii) Are legume- 
based crop rotations a viable mitigation strategy for fluctuations in 
fertilizer prices? (iii) Does the choice of bread wheat genotype affect the 
environmental and economic performance? 
2. Material and methods 
2.1. Case study 
The two on-farm trials were part of a European H2020 project (So­
lACE) that explored the potential for improved varieties and agronomic 
interventions to improve crop production under water and nutrient 
stressed conditions. The trials were conducted under field conditions in 
the 2020 harvest year in Northern Spain in Vi˜nalta (42◦01’N, 04◦55’W, 
772 m a.s.l.) and Villamuera de la Cueza (42◦25’, 04◦69’, 829 m a.s.l), 
hereinafter referred to as Site BY and Site RD respectively (“BY” and 
“RD” represent the pre-crops barley and rapeseed). According to K¨oppen 
(1923), the climate of the area is classified as warm-summer Mediter­
ranean climate (Csb). The mean annual temperature is 12 ◦C, and the 
mean annual rainfall is 440 mm (based on 1985–2015 data). The study 
year was slightly drier than normal with mean rainfall of 391 mm at 
Villamuera and 341 mm at Vi˜nalta. The mean annual temperatures were 
slightly cooler: 10 ◦C at Villamuera and 11 ◦C at Vi˜nalta. Precipitation 
occurs mainly in autumn and spring. The soil is mapped as a Cambic 
Calcisol (World Reference Base for Soil Resources, 2014) with a sandy 
clay loam topsoil for the two sites. 
We conducted a split-split-plot experiment with 96 plots (1.8 m x 
12.8 m each plot; replicated four times) at each site, considering pre- 
crop as the main factor, wheat genotypes as the subplot and N fertil­
ization as the sub-subplot. Four bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) ge­
notypes were included based on their level of drought-tolerance. Touzy 
et al. (2019) tested 210 European genotypes in four water stress sce­
narios and grouped them according to their susceptibility to water 
stress. We selected genotypes from all clusters: Mustang as 
drought-tolerant; Cellule as intermediate; and Nogal and Lutescens as 
susceptible to water stress (more information on the genotype charac­
teristics is provided in the supplementary material, chapter 2). 
Prior to the trial, in the 2018 harvest season, barley was grown at 
Vi˜nalta (Site BY) and rapeseed at Villamuera (Site RD). Afterwards, each 
field was divided into 4 replicate blocks, each with one-half planted to a 
legume and one-half planted to a non-legume. The legume pre-crop 
species vetch (Vicia sativa L.) used as grain was cultivated at both 
sites; whilst non-legume species were barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) at Site 
BY and rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) at Site RD. Vetch was sown in 
November 2018, rapeseed in October 2018 and barley in January 2019. 
All pre-crops were harvested in early summer 2019, with the residues 
being incorporated into the soil. The 8 main plots at each site were then 
divided into a series of genotype subplots. The selected wheat genotypes 
were sown on the same date, at the end of October or the beginning of 
November 2019, at a rate of 160 kg ha−1. At tillering, wheat plots were 
split into three N fertilization sub-subplots, a control treatment and two 
treatments with different fertilizer rates. Therefore, an interaction of N 
and pre-crop was created for each genotype. 
Nitrogen fertilizer was split into two applications and broadcast on 
wheat plots at two growth stages (GS) (Meier, 1997): at tillering (GS22) 
and at stem elongation (GS36–37). Each sub-subplot received a con­
ventional fertilizer; ammonium nitrate sulphate (26 % N), at one of the 
two rates; adjusted (ADJ) or recommended (REC) rate (Table 1). The 
REC rate (110.5 kg N ha−1) was calculated based on the N requirements 
of wheat for an expected yield of 3700 kg ha−1 with the decision support 
system FertiliCalc (Villalobos et al., 2020). As the fertilizer rates were 
adjusted according to the soil inorganic N content (Nmin) in the upper 
0.6 m before the first N application, the REC treatments for wheat plots 
with a legume pre-crop received 32.5 kg N ha−1 less fertilizer than the 
ones without a legume pre-crop. The ADJ rate for wheat plots with a 
legume pre-crop was half the REC rate (39 kg N ha−1), and the ADJ rate 
of the wheat plots without a legume pre-crop was equal to the REC rate 
for wheat plots with a legume pre-crop. The ADJ rate was set to reflect 
typical farmer adjustments to the N fertiliser rate based on soil analysis 
that indicates improved N availability. The control sub-subplots (MIN) 
did not receive any N input. Given that the MIN treatment is not 
representative of common practice, its results are exclusively presented 
in the supplementary material (Tables 8–11). 
Based on soil tests, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were 
applied at a consistent rate before wheat sowing to ensure adequate P 
and K availability. Plant protection products (including herbicides and 
fungicides) were applied according to common farm practice (Table 1). 
An experimental combine undertook harvest in late July or early August 
2020, and the wheat grain yield (GY, kg ha−1) was recorded. A grain 
sub-sample was taken for laboratory analysis, where the grain N con­
centration (GNC, %N) (see supplementary material, Table 2) and 
moisture content (%) were measured. Straw was left on the field as a 
residue. 
2.2. Life cycle assessment 
We used a cradle-to-farm gate LCA approach to quantify and 
compare the environmental impacts of selected genotype, pre-crop 
species and fertilizer input combinations associated with bread wheat 
production. Upstream production of farm inputs (e.g. seed, fertilizer) 
and their use in the field (e.g. operation of machines) were included 
within the system boundary. They were organised into the following 
process groups: tillage, sowing, fertilization, plant protection, harvest

and field emissions. A summary of the inventory data collected is pre­
sented in Table 1. For this study, we assumed that storage and grain 
drying takes place outside the farm gate at the processing stage as the 
focus was at the field level. Background data for externally sourced in­
puts, e.g. the impacts of the production of fertilizers and pesticides, were 
included using the ecoinvent 3.7.1 LCI database. As vetch seeds were not 
available in the database, we used fava bean seeds instead. No co- 
product allocation was required, as the straw was incorporated into 
the soil as part of tillage for the following crop. 
We assessed the collected data through the tool FarmLCA (Meier and 
Moakes, 2019; Schader et al., 2014). The model uses an LCA framework 
and is supported by biophysical systems modelling. It utilizes a modular 
approach to model farm systems and their emissions on an annual basis. 
The quantity of crop residue was not measured but calculated based on 
the IPCC 2019 Tier 2 guidelines, which estimate above and below 
ground residues from the wheat grain yield. Emissions of nitrous oxide 
(N2O) were calculated with IPCC (2019) disaggregated emission factors, 
whilst ammonia emissions from crops were calculated utilising 
EMEP/EEA (2019) (NH3 at Tier 2, NOx at Tier 1) and nitrate losses were 
estimated using the SQCB method (Faist Emmenegger et al., 2009). A 
full description of the model and a table of methods used to estimate 
each field emission type is included in the supplementary material, 
chapter 1. The ecoinvent 3.7.1 LCI database (Wernet et al., 2016) is 
incorporated as the model’s inventory database. We selected six 
system-relevant midpoint impact categories, which are part of the 
IMPACT World+ (Midpoint version 1.28) LCIA methodology set (Bulle 
et al., 2019): The Global Warming Potential (GWP) (over a 100-year 
timeframe) reflected in the impact category climate change 
shorter-term, fossil energy use, marine and freshwater eutrophication, 
freshwater acidification, and water scarcity. To address the uncertainty 
related to the LCA method, we presented the results based on a second 
method, namely the Ecological Scarcity 2021 (BAFU, 2021), in the 
sensitivity analysis.

2.3. Economic assessment 
A gross margin analysis was conducted to determine the economic 
viability of each treatment on a per hectare basis. The economic 
assessment complemented the environmental assessment, using the 
same input data in parallel. Revenue for by-products, such as straw, 
were not accounted for, as it was left on the field as a residue and not 
sold. Unless otherwise stated, the revenue and cost data per unit of input 
or output was based on the agricultural statistics of the Spanish Ministry 
of Agriculture (Gobierno de Espa˜na, 2023) for the years 2019 and 2020. 
Prices for mineral fertilizers were calculated based on their nutrient 
value (N, P, K) consistent with the ecoinvent LCI database (1.06; 0.9; 
0.62 EUR/kg nutrient). The costs for machinery operations and pesti­
cides are based on the dataset incorporated into the FarmLCA tool. 
Machinery costs derive from KTBL (Kuratorium für Technik und Bau­
wesen in der Landwirtschaft e.V, 2020), as it is the most comprehensive, 
reliable and suitable dataset for assessing farm systems across Europe. 
Whilst specific to Germany, processes and data are relevant to com­
mercial agriculture within the EU. Machinery costs included deprecia­
tion, interests for the capital invested in the machine, storage, insurance, 
fees, repairs and maintenance. Other costs associated with the use of a 
machine were the diesel and labour costs, which depend on the working 
time. Wages were adapted to Spanish market conditions in 2019 and 
2020 and based on (Gobierno de Espa˜na, 2023). Pesticide costs have 
been calculated based on the online shop myAgrar (AgrarOnline GmbH, 
2020). All plant protection products containing the active ingredient (a. 
i.) of interest were screened, and the average price was calculated 
considering the different proportions of the a.i. in the products. Land 
costs, such as taxes or rent, were not accounted for. 
2.4. Functional units 
For the LCA of a single year of bread wheat production, we selected a 
functional unit based on land management (per hectare) and on 
production-output (per kg). However, as the pre-crops are composed of 
species with varying compositions (protein, etc.), the results for the two 
years of crop rotation (pre-crop and bread wheat) are presented only as 
per hectare results following Nemecek et al. (2015). The per kg results 
for the one year of wheat cultivation can be found in the supplementary 
material (Table 12), but since they do not provide any additional in­
formation on the 2-year crop rotation, the results are not discussed in 
this study. The per hectare results for the crop rotation were calculated 
by summing the environmental impacts and gross margin of the year of 
pre-crop cultivation and the subsequent bread wheat cultivation and 
then dividing it by the number of years of the crop rotation (two). The 
gross margin is expressed in Euro per hectare and year (EUR ha−1 yr−1). 
3. Results 
Wheat grown after a legume, in this case, vetch, resulted in 18 % 
higher yield than wheat grown after barley. In the ADJ treatments, the 
legume rotation received a lower N input (39 vs. 78 kg N ha−1), but 
wheat yield was still 26 % higher on average than wheat following 
barley. In the REC treatments (78 vs. 110.5 kg N ha−1) it was, on 
average, 11 % higher than wheat grown after barley. 
The wheat yield after vetch compared to rapeseed was, on average, 
6 % (ADJ) and 3 % (REC) higher. Moreover, yields differed strongly 
between genotypes, ranging from 4 % to 22 % higher yield for the 
legume-wheat rotation. 
Table 2 summarises the agronomic, economic and environmental 
indicator results for the trials, to allow for further discussion. The results 
are presented for the two-year rotations per hectare and year. 
3.1. Environmental impact under reduced fertilizer input 
In this study, the introduction of a legume in the crop rotation and 
the associated reduction in N fertilizer use generally led to lower envi­
ronmental impacts per hectare for most of the analysed impact cate­
gories. The GHG emissions of the vetch-wheat rotation were 24 % lower 
than those of the barley-wheat rotation and 11 % lower than those of the 
rapeseed-wheat rotation (see Fig. 1a). 
The differences between the two types of rotations are mainly due to 
(i) the impact of pre-crop cultivation with different inputs and agricul­
tural practices, (ii) the impact of fertilizer production (pre-farm) influ­
enced by the different N fertilizer rates in the year of wheat cultivation 
and (iii) the field emissions (e.g. N2O), which are mainly influenced by 
the rate of N fertilizer applied (on-farm) and the quantity of residues 
from wheat cultivation. 
The results for most of the other impact categories were in line with 
this trend of lower impacts. The per hectare impacts on marine eutro­
phication (BY: −12 %; RD: −4 %) freshwater acidification (BY: −39 %; 
RD: −26 %), water scarcity (BY: −38 %; RD: −1 %) and energy use (BY: 
−18 %; RD: −6 %) were lower for all treatments in the vetch-wheat 
rotation. Only the impacts on freshwater eutrophication deviate from 
these results. More P2O5 fertilizer was used in vetch cultivation 
compared to rapeseed and barley, which resulted in a 3 % (BY) and 6 % 
(RD) higher impact on freshwater eutrophication for the legume-wheat 
rotation. 
3.2. Economic viability of legume-based cropping rotations 
The economic results indicated that the vetch-wheat rotation was 
less profitable than the rapeseed-wheat rotation, but similarly profitable 
to the barley-wheat rotation. The lower N fertilizer use in the legume- 
wheat rotations saved about 8 % of the total costs in the year of wheat 
cultivation. In addition, the costs of growing vetch as a pre-crop were 
9 % lower than for rapeseed and 22 % lower than for barley. However, 
revenue for vetch was 52 % lower, which resulted in a negative gross 
margin in the year of pre-crop cultivation. In the year of wheat culti­
vation, the revenue for the vetch-wheat rotation at Site BY was 18 % 
higher, but the negative gross margin from the pre-crop year reduced the 
total gross margin, resulting in only 1 % higher gross margin considering 
both years. At Site RD, the difference in revenue in the second year of the 
rotation was 5 % higher for the vetch-wheat rotation compared to 
rapeseed-wheat. As a result, the overall gross margin for the two-year 
sequence was 18 % lower for the vetch-wheat compared to the 
rapeseed-wheat rotation. 
3.3. Sensitivity analysis 
In order to address uncertainties associated with the results of the 
environmental analysis, we employed a secondary LCA method, namely 
the Ecological Scarcity method (BAFU, 2021). The method uses "eco-­
factors" to assign weights to the impact categories, based on the distance 
to predefined targets. The greater the eco-factor, expressed in eco-points 
(EP), the higher the environmental impact. The EP of all 20 impact 
categories add up to the total EP. Table 3 shows the total EP and the EP 
of the impact category global warming, which is comparable to climate 
change in the Impact World+ method. More detailed results with the 
Ecological Scarcity method can be found in the supplementary material 
(Table 14). 
Despite variations in numerical values due to differing units, the 
analysis reveals consistent outcomes across both methods, underscoring 
the robustness of our findings amidst uncertainty. 
Farm-level economics varied considerably depending on location 
and pre-crop species. In addition, fertilizer and grain prices have been 
very volatile in recent years. The price of UAN increased by up to 455 % 
between 2020 and 2023 (Trading Economics, 2022). The price of wheat 
increased by up to 139 % (finanzen.net GmbH, 2023). We conducted a 
sensitivity analysis of the gross margin at different fertilizer and wheat 
prices. However, such scenarios would also potentially cause an increase 
in barley, rapeseed and vetch prices due to higher production costs and

alternative use in feedstuffs. In nine scenarios, we increased the N-fer­
tilizer price by 250 % and 500 % and the wheat grain price by 100 % 
and 200 %. The difference in gross margin between the legume-wheat 
rotation and the corresponding rotation without legumes is shown 
aggregated over all genotypes in Fig. 2. 
The results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the 
results, as the trends remained mostly the same considering the strong 
price increases. After increasing the N fertilizer price by a factor of three 
and a half, the result changed only marginally. The vetch-wheat became 
more profitable than the barley-wheat rotation (Fig. 2). However, even 
after increasing the N fertilizer price by a factor of six, the legume-wheat 
rotation was still financially less attractive than the rapeseed-wheat 
rotation, although the difference in gross margin decreased. An in­
crease in wheat grain price favoured the higher yielding rotations, which 
were the legume-wheat rotations (except genotype Mustang at Site RD, 
supplementary material Table 6). The difference in gross margin shrank 
but was still higher for the rapeseed-wheat rotations. An increase of both 
N and wheat prices in different variations made the legume-wheat 
rotation also slightly more profitable than the rapeseed-wheat rotation. 
When it comes to the economic result, grain yield is a very decisive 
variable. Therefore, during the last decades cultivar breeding has 
focused on boosting yield. But not only quantity, also the quality is 
important for selling bread wheat, which is associated with processing 
attributes, such as the grain protein content (Geyer et al., 2022). How­
ever, several studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between 
grain yield and grain protein content (e.g. Oury and Godin, 2007; Laidig 
et al., 2017). Commonly, for bread wheat a premium is paid for a high 
protein content, but if it is too low and not suitable for baking, it can only 
be sold at a lower price for use as feed. In this study, no price premium or 
discount was applied, but to reflect this common practice, we have 
included a 21 % (40 EUR/t) premium for a protein content >12 % and a 
10 % (19 EUR/t) discount for a protein content <10 % in the sensitivity 
analysis. As prices and ranges can vary widely, we have decided to base 
the analysis on values that are common in the region. We repeated the 
sensitivity analysis, including the protein premium/discount and the 
results changed slightly (Fig. 3). Protein content tended to be higher for 
wheat grown after barley and rapeseed than after vetch. In contrast to 
Fig. 2, in the baseline scenario and with a 3.5-fold increase in the price of

N fertilizer, the barley-wheat rotation had a higher gross margin than 
the vetch-wheat rotation. The same was observed when the wheat grain 
price increased. However, in the scenarios with a combination of both 
prices the vetch-wheat rotations were more profitable than 
barley-wheat. Only if the wheat grain price increased by a factor of three 
and the N fertilizer price increased by a factor of six, vetch-wheat out­
performed rapeseed-wheat. 
3.4. Differences in genotypes 
The results remained consistent across most indicators for all geno­
types. Variations were observed exclusively in indicators directly or 
indirectly influenced by yield, such as gross margin, impact on climate 
change and on marine eutrophication. Cellule had a 45 % higher gross 
margin than Lutescens, considering the two-year rotation. The drought- 
resistant genotype Mustang had a 24 % higher gross margin than 
Lutescens and 2 % higher gross margin than Nogal, which are classified 
as susceptible to water stress. On a per hectare basis for the two-year 
rotation, the highest-yielding genotype Cellule had a 4 % higher 
impact for climate change than the lowest-yielding genotype Lutescens. 
The impact is greater for the genotypes with higher yields, mainly 
because the estimated amount of crop residues is greater and their 
decomposition leads to higher N2O emissions. Regarding marine 
eutrophication, higher yield leads to higher N uptake and, thus, lower 
nitrate leaching. Cellule had a 7 % lower impact on marine 
eutrophication per hectare than Lutescens on a two-year basis. 
As Cellule was the highest-yielding genotype, its protein content was 
on average the lowest of the four genotypes. Its protein content was 
below 12 % in all treatments and mostly even below 10 %. The above 
results are presented without a protein premium/discount, but Fig. 4 
illustrates the effects if the protein content were taken into account. On 
average, wheat grain of the Cellule genotype would have to be sold as 
feed, but it would still be the genotype with the highest gross margin due 
to its high yield. Lutescens, on the other hand, had a comparatively high 
protein content and would have received a premium at site RD, but 
would continue to be the genotype with the lowest gross margin. 
4. Discussion 
4.1. Environmental impact of legumes in crop rotations 
Replacing synthetic N fertilizer with legumes that can fix N, as part of 
a two-year cropping rotation, decreased the modelled impact on climate 
change and marine eutrophication. In the present study, 32.5 (REC) and 
39 (ADJ) kg N ha−1 in the form of ammonium nitrate sulphate fertilizer 
were saved when legumes were included in the crop rotation, leading to 
a reduction in emissions and energy consumption associated with the 
production, transport and use of fertilizer. 
Using vetch before wheat resulted in average energy (MJdeprived ha−1 
yr−1) savings of 18 % compared to the barley-wheat rotation and 6 %

compared to rapeseed-wheat. This result is comparable to that of a study 
by Nemecek et al. (2008), in which N fertilizer input was reduced by 
23 kg ha−1, which resulted in fossil fuel savings of 14 % by replacing 
wheat with peas in one year of a five-year crop rotation. 
For the two-year sequence, greenhouse gas emissions were 24 % 
lower for vetch-wheat (total 1385 kg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1) compared to the 
barley-wheat rotation (total 1830 kg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1) at Site BY, and 
11 % lower for vetch-wheat (total 1406 kg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1) compared 
to rapeseed-wheat (total 1573 kg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1) at Site RD. The total 
quantity of CO2-eq ha−1 emitted for one year of wheat cultivation varies 
quite strongly when comparing other studies on wheat production (e.g. 
from 364 kg CO2-eq ha−1 in Barton et al., 2014 to 3720 kg CO2-eq ha−1 
in Naudin et al., 2014). Differences in yield and field emissions can be 
due to the location, such as the experiment in Barton et al., 2014 took 
place in Australia with differences in climate, precipitation and soil 
properties. Furthermore, different methods may be used to estimate field 
emissions, and background data for e.g. fertilizer production may come 
from different databases or database versions. Moreover, different types 
of fertilizer and the energy mix of its producing country can lead to 
differences in impacts. Or simply the amount of fertilizer applied. In 
Naudin et al., 2014, 190 kg ha−1 of ammonium nitrate was used, so 
depending on the database, fertilizer production and transport can 
already lead to more than 1600 kg CO2-eq ha−1. 
Nevertheless, our observation of a proportional reduction in emis­
sions due to substitution by legumes and the associated reduction in N 
fertilizer use is in line with the results of other studies. In Nemecek et al. 
(2008), N fertilizer was reduced by 23 kg N ha−1 when wheat was 
replaced by peas in the rotation, resulting in 11 % lower CO2-eq ha−1. 
The lentil and dry pea rotations in MacWilliam et al. (2014) reduced the 
effects on global warming by 17–22 % and the introduction of lupin 
pre-crops reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 30 %. 
In this study, an average of 159 kg CO2-eq ha−1 can be attributed to 
the production and transport of the additional fertilizer used in the 
barley and rapeseed-wheat rotation in the year of wheat production. The 
other main contributor to the impact on climate change is field emis­
sions, which were reduced by an average of 102 kg CO2-eq ha−1 in the 
legume rotations. Field emissions in this case mainly reflect nitrogen 
oxides (N2O), whose global warming potential is about 300 times higher 
than that of CO2. Nitrogen oxide emissions are caused by losses from the 
N fertilizer input and through the decomposition of crop residues. As a 
result, the higher yielding treatments, which were mainly the legume- 
wheat rotations, had higher N2O emissions, due to a greater estimated 
quantity of crop residue, but overall lower emissions, due to lower fer­
tilizer inputs. 
Apart from these aspects, emissions from legume crops may well be 
higher due to greater N levels within the field residues, and this is re­
flected in the IPCC 2019 Tier 2 methodology adopted here. Biological 
nitrogen fixation is not included as a direct source of N2O because of the 
lack of evidence of significant emissions arising from the fixation process 
itself. Rochette and Janzen (2005) concluded that the N2O emissions 
induced by the growth of legume crops may be estimated solely as a 
function of the above-ground and below-ground N inputs from crop 
residue. For this assessment, soil organic changes were not considered, 
therefore, the release of N by mineralisation of soil organic matter as a 
result of a change of land use or management is not included. 
Freshwater acidification was lower for the vetch-wheat rotation 
compared to both barley-wheat and rapeseed-wheat, (39 % and 26 %, 
respectively). It was mainly caused by ammonia volatilization. Espe­
cially in alkaline soils, ammonium (NH4
+), which was part of the N fer­
tilizer used in this study, can be converted into ammonia gas (NH3) and 
emitted into the atmosphere. It can travel long distances and is deposited 
in soils and waterways via rain, altering their acidity, which can harm 
species (Bulle et al., 2019). However, this risk is much higher for fer­
tilizers containing urea (Brentrup et al., 2001). According to Peoples 
et al. (1995a, as cited in Crews and Peoples, 2004), legume pre-crops 
could reduce the risk of ammonia volatilization during crop residue 
deposition but at the same time, potentially result in higher denitrifi­
cation losses of N2O (Hansen et al., 2021; Sanz-Cobena et al., 2014). 
Nevertheless, the increase in N2O emissions caused mainly by legume 
residue decomposition is compensated by the reduction in direct and 
indirect emissions associated with N fertilizer savings (Guardia et al., 
2019). 
Regardless of the source of N, a higher yield is associated with 
greater biomass that takes up more N. As a result, less nitrate is available 
for leaching into groundwater, rivers and subsequently, coastal marine 
ecosystems where it can cause eutrophication. Reducing the N input in 
the first place can reduce this risk of marine eutrophication. In this 
study, part of the synthetic N fertilizer was replaced by legume pre- 
crops, but also legumes can promote nitrate leaching before the subse­
quent crop can take it up. Only few studies provide insights into this 
topic and uncertainties are high (Crews and Peoples, 2004; Masoni et al., 
2015). In the underlying model of this study, nitrate emissions are 
calculated based on the SQCB tool (Mireille Faist Emmenegger et al., 
2009). Overall, the use of the pre-crop vetch before wheat resulted in a 
12 % lower impact on marine eutrophication compared to the 
barley-wheat rotation but only a 4 % lower impact compared to the 
rapeseed-wheat rotation. In this study, the two years of the rotation were 
modelled separately, and the impacts were then summed. Therefore, 
most of the nitrate provided by the legume pre-crop was modelled as lost 
when residues were incorporated into the soil, whereas some of it would 
likely be taken up by the wheat crop following the legumes. As a result, 
the reduction in the impact on marine eutrophication from the intro­
duction of legume pre-crops estimated in this study may be even greater 
than we have reported. 
The impact on water scarcity was 38 % (BY) and 1 % (RD) lower for 
the vetch-wheat rotation. In the ecoinvent LCI database, the impact on 
water scarcity was much greater for barley seed than for fava bean seed 
used to model vetch, which was unavailable in the database. We chose 
fava bean seed, as their cultivation is quite similar to vetch, however, 
fava bean seed in the database are not specific to Spain and have a higher 
yield than vetch in this study. As a result, the impact per kg is lower and 
therefore might be slightly underestimated. However, for most impact 
categories the contribution of seed to the overall impact is between 0 % 
and 20 %. Only water scarcity is largely driven by the seed and in the 
case of the barley seed from the database, mainly caused by irrigation. If 
the vetch grown to produce the seed used in our trial were rainfed, we 
would expect the fava bean seed to be a good proxy, but if they were 
irrigated, the result would be quite different. 
Freshwater eutrophication was the only impact category where the 
impact of the vetch-wheat rotation was slightly higher (3 % BY; 6 % 
RD), due to the larger quantity of P2O5 fertilizer used in the vetch 
cultivation in this study. 
This study highlights the positive role legumes can play in reducing 
reliance on synthetic N fertilizer and the problems of assessing multi- 
year cropping rotations due to differing products (e.g. protein con­
tent). It remains difficult to assess the true productivity of a crop rotation 
without using alternative functional units, which may not be compara­
ble to mainstream studies. Furthermore, modelling of nitrogen transfer 
between crop years is challenging within an LCA focus when most as­
sessments are on an annual basis. Therefore, emissions from lost nutri­
ents, and especially crops such as legumes can be overestimated. 
The results of this study are limited to two trials in northern Spain 
with different non-legume pre-crops in one year. A different climate or 
weather during the growing season can strongly influence the perfor­
mance of different crops. Consequently, our results are specific to the 
assessed year (2020), and the conclusions drawn should not be gener­
alised beyond this context. Nevertheless, most researchers reported that 
a precedent legume crop increases the performance of subsequent ce­
reals compared to non-legume crops (Angus et al., 2015; Gan et al., 
2015). Though, whilst the response to N fertilization of the subsequent 
wheat will greatly depend on the N supply from the pre-crop (Cernay 
et al., 2018), the N supply might be low if the pre-crop growth is limited.

On-farm trials such as this case study offer numerous benefits for 
agricultural research. They provide a real-world setting that allows re­
searchers to evaluate the performance of agricultural practices under 
authentic conditions. As the research takes place on the farmers’ own 
fields and on topics that are relevant to them, farmers are more inter­
ested, motivated and more likely to adopt the practices later on 
(Kyveryga, 2019). On-farm trials foster collaboration between re­
searchers and farmers, promote hybridisation of knowledge and ensure 
that the results are both scientifically sound and applicable to the 
farming community (Lacoste et al., 2022). However, on-farm trials are 
also associated with risks. Indeed, we were unable to use the data from 
2021 because the fertilization plan was not adhered to. Nevertheless, 
our results are consistent with those of other studies and provide an 
insight into the topic from an environmental and economic perspective. 
4.2. Economic viability of legume-based crop rotations 
From an economic perspective, partial substitution of synthetic N 
fertilizer with legume-fixed N in the year of wheat cultivation led on 
average to (i) lower N fertilizer costs of about 8 % of total costs; (ii) 
higher revenues of 18 % (BY) and 5 % (RD) due to higher yields; and (iii) 
a 32 % (BY) and 11 % (RD) higher gross margin. Thus, in the year of 
wheat cultivation, it tends to be more profitable to use legumes as pre- 
crops (see also Nemecek et al., 2015). However, several studies have 
shown that the cultivation of a legume in the preceding year is less 
profitable for the farmer when subsidies are not accounted for (e.g. 
Brock et al., 2016; Preissel et al., 2015). There may be differences 
depending on the choice of legume pre-crop. This study was limited to a 
single legume pre-crop, vetch, whose grains were sold as fodder. The 
costs for cultivating vetch were 22 % lower than for barley and 9 % 
lower compared to rapeseed. However, the revenue of vetch was 52 % 
lower than barley and rapeseed. As a result, the gross margin for culti­
vating vetch was negative and positive for the other pre-crops. Thus, 
taking into account the results of the two-year crop rotation lead on 
average to a lower gross margin of −18 % for vetch-wheat compared to 
rapeseed-wheat and 1 % higher gross margin compared to barley-wheat. 
In the context of this case study, we can conclude that using a legume 
pre-crop before bread wheat results in a lower environmental impact but 
its profitability is strongly dependent on the pre-crop species. While the 
wheat-rotation with vetch was similarly profitable to barley, it could not 
compete with rapeseed when assessing the two years of crop rotation. 
Therefore, farmers would require some form of financial incentive to 
change rotations and reduce environmental impacts. This is in line with 
the results from Barton et al. (2014), who compared a lupin-wheat with 
a wheat-wheat crop rotation. In their study, an incentive of 93$ per 
tonne of carbon dioxide equivalents reduced would be required to 
promote the inclusion of legumes in the crop rotation. 
The results of this study are limited to the pre-crops vetch, barley and 
rapeseed. The fact that the difference between the results of the two non- 
legume pre-crops, barley and rapeseed, in this study was quite sub­
stantial shows that not only the choice of legume pre-crop, but also the 
counterfactual can strongly influence the result. In addition, the culti­
vation of the same crop in the year preceding the non-legume pre-crops 
may resulted in a potential side-effect on agronomic outcomes due to 
increased disease pressure. Further research in this field with other 
legume and non-legume pre-crops over a longer period of time could be 
of great benefit to the literature. The agronomic effect of different break- 
crops on the wheat yield has been investigated in many studies. Kirke­
gaard et al. (2008) and Angus et al. (2015) showed that rapeseed is 
superior to other break crops in terms of more efficient N recovery, high 
levels of residual N and suppression of cereal pathogens. Wheat 
following barley, on the other hand, was similar to wheat following 
wheat, thus missing the break-crop benefits. 
A limitation of this study is that a small part of the economic data 
(machinery and pesticide costs) originated from a German cost database 
implemented in our model. Although these values may vary for Spain, 
absolute values of the parameters were not crucial to the analysis, but 
rather their relative values were important for comparing the treat­
ments. The key variables for the analysis were gathered from Spanish 
databases. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis with varying fertilizer 
and wheat grain prices showed that only a very strong increase in the N 
fertilizer price (+500 %) and the wheat price (+100 %) made the 
legume-wheat rotation more profitable in direct comparison to the 
rapeseed-wheat rotation. An increase in the wheat grain price or N 
fertilizer price alone did not change the overall result. Hence, from an 
economic perspective, legumes outperform most alternative crops only 
in the face of very strong price fluctuations. 
If a premium (>12 %) or discount (<10 %) for the grain protein 
content is taken into account, a 500 % increase in the N fertiliser price 
and a 200 % increase in the grain price are needed to make the vetch- 
wheat rotation more profitable than rapeseed-wheat. The vetch-wheat 
rotations tend to have a lower protein content than the rapeseed and 
barley-wheat rotations. This is in line with the well-documented inverse 
relationship of protein content and yield, since the vetch-wheat rota­
tions in this study had a higher grain yield. 
4.3. Effect of different bread wheat genotypes 
The results showed an effect of genotype only on variables influenced 
by yield. The high-yielding genotype Cellule was identified as moder­
ately drought-tolerant in a panel of 210 European genotypes (Touzy 
et al., 2019). The low-yielding genotype Lutescens, on the other hand, 
was identified as susceptible to water stress. Li et al., (2019) associated 
tolerance to drought with a greater rooting depth. Genotypes with more 
developed root systems can access more soil resources, such as N and 
water, and increase or stabilize yield and N use efficiency under 
low-input conditions (Lassaletta et al., 2023). The deep roots of the 
genotype Mustang were identified by Odone et al. (2023). Additionally, 
Touzy et al. (2019) categorized Mustang as drought-tolerant, which is 
further supporting the association between deep roots and its ability to 
withstand drought conditions. 
The two-year gross margin of the highest yielding genotype Cellule 
was 45 % higher than that of the lowest yielding genotype Lutescens. 
However, Cellule had the lowest grain protein content of all four ge­
notypes tested, so that on average a protein discount would be incurred, 
while Lutescens would receive a protein premium. Despite this, the 
Cellule genotype would still have the highest gross margin due to its 
high yield and Lutescens the lowest. This indicates that yield tends to be 
more important than protein content when it comes to overall 
profitability. 
When analysing the environmental impact of the second year of 
wheat cultivation on a per hectare basis, the higher yielding genotypes 
had higher N2O emissions (climate change) due to the greater amount of 
decomposing crop residues, but less nitrate leaching (marine eutrophi­
cation) due to greater nitrogen offtake. 
This study is limited by the inclusion of four genotypes selected to 
represent the varying degrees of drought tolerance. While this selection 
provides valuable insight, it does not capture the full range of genetic 
diversity within the wider wheat population, highlighting the impor­
tance of considering additional genotypes in future studies. 
5. Conclusion 
In this case study, the introduction of legumes into the crop rotation, 
to replace part of the synthetic N fertilizer, decreased most environ­
mental impacts per hectare when assessing the two years of crop rota­
tion. However, in comparison to the pre-crop rapeseed the trade-off was 
lower profitability for the farmer, as the cost savings from reduced fer­
tilizer use could not compensate for the poor economic outcome of 
legume cultivation. Only with very strongly increased fertilizer and 
grain prices, the legume pre-crop vetch did slightly outperform rape­
seed. This highlights the importance of exploring financial incentives to

encourage farmers to include legumes in their crop rotations, especially 
as reducing synthetic fertilizers by 20 % by 2030 is an objective of the 
European Green Deal Farm to Fork strategy. Crop rotations with le­
gumes could also play a key role for human consumption as part of the 
so-called “planetary healthy” diet recommended by the EAT-Lancet 
Commission. 
The choice of bread wheat genotype had a strong effect on the eco­
nomic performance in this study. The moderately drought-tolerant ge­
notype Cellule generated the highest gross margin, even if a discount 
was applied due to its low grain protein content. The genotype Mustang, 
which is classified as drought-tolerant and deep-rooted, ranked second 
after Cellule. The evidence for whether genotypes with deep or powerful 
root systems are better suited to reduced fertilizer conditions with 
legume pre-crops remains unclear. Therefore, further studies with a 
larger range of genotypes and conditions over a longer period of time are 
needed to confirm whether such root traits consistently make a signifi­
cant difference.
