Abstract 
Background  Crop rotation is an agronomic practice that is known to enhance productivity and yield, and decrease 
pest and disease pressure. Economic and other factors have increased the frequency of certain crops, including can-
ola, with unknown effects on the below ground microbial communities that impact plant health and performance. 
This study investigated the effect of 12 years of crop rotation including canola-wheat; canola-pea-barley; and unro-
tated canola across three geographic sites in Western Canada with diverse soil types and environmental conditions. 
To provide data on mature, established crop rotation strategies, root exudate profiles, soil nutrient fluxes, and bacterial 
and fungal microbial community profiles were determined at the flowering stage in the final two (canola) years of the 
12-year rotations.
Results  After 12 years of rotation, nutrient fluxes were affected in the soil in an inconsistent manner, with K, ­NO3, Mg, 
Ca, P, and Fe fluxes variably impacted by rotation depending on the year and site of sampling. As expected, rotation 
positively influenced yield and oil content, and decreased disease pressure from Leptosphaeria and Alternaria. In two 
of the three sites, root exudate profiles were significantly influenced by crop rotation. Bacterial soil, root, and rhizos-
phere communities were less impacted by crop rotation than the fungal communities. Fungal sequences that were 
associated with specific rotation strategies were identified in the bulk soil, and included known fungal pathogens in 
the canola-only strategy. Two closely related fungal sequences identified as Olpidium brassicae were extremely abun-
dant at all sites in both years. One of these sequences was observed uniquely at a single site and was significantly 
associated with monocropped canola; moreover, its abundance correlated negatively with yield in both years.
Conclusions  Long-term canola monoculture affected root exudate profiles and soil nutrient fluxes differently in the 
three geographic locations. Bacterial communities were less impacted by rotation compared to the fungal commu-
nities, which consistently exhibited changes in composition in all ecological niches at all sites, in both years. Fungal 
sequences identified as O. brassicae were highly abundant at all sites, one of which was strongly associated with 
canola monoculture. Soil management decisions should include consideration of the effects on the microbial ecosys-
tems associated with the plants in order to inform best management practices.

Background
Canola (Brassica napus L.) is an important crop for 
Canadian producers and both the total acreage and fre-
quency of canola on individual farms have increased sig-
nificantly in the past 20 years [1]. As a result, continuous 
or 1 in 2-year canola rotations have become increasingly 
common. It is important to examine the impacts of can-
ola rotation length to support best management recom-
mendations and mitigate agronomic risk with respect to 
yield and pest management [2].
Diverse crop rotations comprise an important facet of 
sustainable, resilient production systems aiding in dis-
ease suppression, nutrient cycling and risk mitigation 
[3]. While the importance of crop rotation for reducing 
pathogen host-crop incidence is acknowledged [4] less 
is known about the indirect impacts of canola frequency 
on the broader soil and plant microbiome and how this 
subsequently affects soil nutrient cycling and uptake. 
Compared to monoculture, diverse rotations have higher 
levels of nutrient cycling [5], increases in bioavailable 
nitrogen, soil organic matter, and available potassium 
[6], and appear to have broader soil microbial metabolic 
capabilities, perhaps owing to a greater diversity of resi-
due input types [7, 8]. Canola is known to have diverse 
and abundant root and rhizosphere microbiomes [9–11]. 
This microbiome has many important roles in plant 
health including nutrient uptake, resistance to pests 
and other stresses and for maintaining soil fertility [12]. 
Canola tissues have a characteristic biochemical com-
position (e.g. glucosinolates) that have a variety of roles 
including allelopathic functions [13] and inhibition of 
microbial nitrification [14].Therefore, planting fields to 
canola is expected to have strong short term impacts on 
soil microbial community structure and function as well 
as nutrient availability [15]. Whether these effects are 
temporary [16] or longer lasting may depend on the fre-
quency of canola cropping, since the influence of poten-
tially persistent allelopathic compounds on soil biota is 
unknown. Brassica spp. are among the minority of plants 
that do not associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 
(AMF), ubiquitous symbiotic soil fungi that have impor-
tant roles in water and nutrient (especially P) acquisition 
by many other plants [17]. Non-host crops decrease the 
AMF inoculum potential in the soil and mycorrhizal col-
onization of subsequent host crops (e.g. cereals) and may 
decrease translocation of fresh plant C to soil microbes 
[18–20]. Because canola is not an AMF host crop, it may 
have other means of acquiring P such as direct excretion 
of P solubilizing organic acids as reflected in the root 
exudates. Soil monocropped to maize plants featured 
decreased P and Mg bioavailability, and the plants them-
selves had a strong effect on the composition of the soil 
microbial communities, presumably through interactions 
of the root/rhizosphere with the soil microbiota [21]. 
Root exudates aid in plant nutrient acquisition and also 
support increased abundance and activity of soil micro-
organisms. Pioneering work on root exudates and myc-
orrhizal fungal enzymes showed that that plant- and 
fungal-derived compounds are involved in the turnover 
of mineral nutrients in Populus spp. [22]. In addition, the 
pattern of the production of root-derived phytochemi-
cals was determined to follow developmental cues and 
the root exudates produced by the plant were correlated 
to the metabolic capacity of the soil microbiota in Arabi-
dopsis grown in natural soils [23]. The composition of the 
root-associated microbiota was determined to be selected 
by the plant at specific stages of Arabidopsis develop-
ment through the production of root exudates [24]. As 
a result of this and other work, plant root exudates are 
now thought to be a primary mechanism through which 
plants manipulate and shape their microbiomes [25]. 
Together, these characteristics can act as soil microbiome 
disruptors, with greater potential benefits and detriments 
when canola is grown with high frequency.
This study encompasses the final two years of a long-
term rotation study to assess the long term (> 10 years) 
adaptive differences in soil microbiome characteristics 
for both glufosinate-resistant and glyphosate-resistant 
canola grown in continuous canola (C-C), canola-wheat 
(C-W) and canola-pea-barley (C-P-B) rotations. We pur-
posefully chose the final two years of this rotation study 
to determine the long-term effects of rotation, exclud-
ing the potentially confounding temporal effects of crop 
rotation establishment on soil microbial community 
profiles. These canola-intensive vs. diverse rotations 
were examined at three sites on the Canadian prairies 
by simultaneously measuring nutrient fluxes, changes in 
soil, rhizosphere and root bacterial and fungal commu-
nity structures and the secretion of root exudates. We 
hypothesized that less diverse rotations would result in 
(1) reduced soil N, P and K fluxes, (2) increased abun-
dance of organic acids secreted from roots, and (3) a 
reduction in the bacterial and fungal diversity as well as 
compositional changes in the soil, rhizosphere and root. 
By examining multiple indicators of plant and soil health, 
we identified specific agronomic consequences of low 
diversity canola rotations.
Methods
Sample collection
Experimental fields were located at three sites on the 
Canadian prairies to capture regional differences in cli-
mate and soil type. Sites near Swift Current (lat 50.28, 
long − 107.76) and Scott (lat 50.15, long − 106.58) in Sas-
katchewan are in the Brown and Dark Brown soil zones, 
respectively, while the samples taken near Lacombe,

Alberta (lat 52.45, long − 113.75) are from the Black soil 
zone. Mean annual precipitation was 345  mm at Swift 
Current, 348  mm at Scott and 451  mm at Lacombe 
(ECCC, ClimateData.ca). As part of a complete rand-
omized block design, four replicate plots at each site were 
sown with both InVigor® L241C and Roundup Ready® 
75–42 canola cultivars in monoculture, canola-wheat 
or canola-pea-barley rotations. The field study was set 
up as an all phases rotation ensuring a canola phase was 
grown for each rotation in every year. Bulk soil, rhizos-
phere and root samples were sampled in the canola phase 
of all 3 rotations in both 2018 and 2019, representing 
the 11th and 12th years of the long-term experiment. 
At peak flowering, plants from each row (3–4 plants 
total per plot) were harvested along with the surround-
ing 1–1.5 kg of soil using a hand trowel, bagged together, 
and stored on ice until processing, which was completed 
within 48 h. Bulk soil was mixed and sieved with a 2 mm 
stainless steel sieve. Plant roots were clipped just below 
the crown and shaken to discard loosely adhering soil. 
To collect the strongly-adhering rhizosphere soil, plant 
roots were immersed in 200 ml of sterile 0.05 M NaCl for 
25 min on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. Rhizosphere soil 
was collected by centrifugation at 5000×g for 15 min [26]. 
The supernatant from the centrifugation that was used to 
collect the rhizosphere soil contained the root exudates 
and was frozen at − 20 °C until analysis (see below). Root 
samples were then rinsed with additional 0.05M NaCl 
and cut into small pieces using a sterile scalpel. Aliquots 
of the sieved bulk soil, rhizosphere soil and root tissue 
were stored at − 20 °C prior to DNA extraction.
Agronomic indicators
Alternaria blackspot was assessed by collecting 50 green 
pods per plot at or prior to swathing. Incidence was 
determined by the number of pods affected with Alter-
naria out of those assessed per plot. After swathing, 50 
canola stem bases/roots were collected from each plot, 
gently washed and dried, and stored in sealed plastic bags 
at − 20  °C until processed. Incidence was expressed as 
the percentage of canola stems that exhibited symptoms 
of blackleg. Plot grain yield was measured using a plot 
combine harvester outfitted with a sample weigh sys-
tem. Samples were cleaned and true yield recorded. An 
approximately 1 kg subsample of the plot yield was taken 
from the combine and cleaned to be free of weeds prior 
to quality analysis. A subsample from each cleaned plot 
sample was taken and seed oil and protein concentra-
tions were determined using a near-infrared reflectance 
spectrophotometer, as is recommended by the Canadian 
Grain Commission (https://​www.​grain​scana​da.​gc.​ca/​en/​
grain-​resea​rch/​export-​quali​ty/​oilse​eds/​metho​ds-​tests.​
html). Moisture was measured on each sample using a 
moisture meter and values adjusted to all be reported at 
the same 8.5% moisture basis.
Root exudate analysis
The supernatant containing the root exudates was fil-
tered through Whatman No. 42 paper, pH adjusted to 
6–7, and concentrated using a vacuum manifold and 
Strata-X-AW 33  μm Polymeric Weak Anion-Exchange 
tubes (Phenomenex, USA). Each Strata column was acti-
vated with 6 mL of methanol followed by 6 mL of Milli-
Q water. Samples (approximately 220  mL) were added 
to the columns and the vacuum was applied to pull the 
liquid through the columns and bind the organic acids, 
with a rate of application such that individual drops came 
off of the column at approximately 1 drop per second. 
After sample application, the columns were washed with 
2 × 5  mL of 25  mM ammonium acetate (pH 6–7) and 
the vacuum was applied until all liquid had entered the 
column and it appeared dry. Organic acids were subse-
quently eluted from the columns using 2 × 5  mL of 5% 
ammonium hydroxide dissolved in methanol. The sam-
ples were evaporated until dry using a Labconoco Rapid-
Vap™ ­N2 Evaporation System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
MA, USA), resuspended in 5  mL of 10  mM KCl, and 
analyzed using ion chromatography (IC; DIONEX ICS-
2000 employing suppressed conductivity detection with 
an AS18 column; Thermo Fisher Scientific, ON, Canada). 
Organic acid elution times were compared to standards 
for formate, malate, oxalate, succinate, and tartrate [27].
Soil nutrient fluxes
Soil nutrient fluxes were measured using Plant Root Sim-
ulator (PRS) Probes® (Western Ag, Saskatoon, SK, Can-
ada) positioned at 3 locations in one row, 2 m apart from 
each other, within each plot at an approximate depth of 
6″. Anion and cation probes were spaced 4″ apart and 
positioned approximately 4″ from the seed row and 
2″ from the fertilizer band. PRS probes® were initially 
placed 4 weeks prior to sample collection and exchanged 
after two, four and six weeks from the initial placement 
(i.e., every two weeks). Anion and cation probes were col-
lected and processed by Western Ag at times correspond-
ing to the period 2 weeks prior to sample collection, at 
the time of sample collection, and two weeks after sam-
ple collection. At collection, all probes were rinsed with 
deionized water to remove all soil particles and stored 
in a sealed plastic bag at 4 °C prior to analysis. Adsorbed 
nutrients were quantified by transferring to sealed plastic 
bags containing 17.5 mL of 0.5 M HCl and eluted for one 
hour. Inorganic N ­(NH4 and ­NO3) in the eluent was then 
determined colorimetrically using automated flow injec-
tion analysis with a Skalar San++ Analyzer (Skalar Inc., 
Netherlands). The remaining nutrients (P, K, S, Ca, Mg, 
Page 4 of 14
Town et al. Environmental Microbiome           (2023) 18:40 
Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and B) were measured using induc-
tively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry (Optima ICP-
OES 8300, PerkinElmer Inc., USA). All standards and 
controls are prepared in a 0.5M HCl matrix equivalent to 
that of the samples.
DNA sequencing
Total genomic DNA was extracted from 250 mg of the 
soil and rhizosphere samples using the DNeasy Pow-
erSoil extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) after 
homogenizing samples using the Qiagen vortex adapter 
and vortexing horizontally for 10  min. Total genomic 
DNA was extracted from 50  mg of the root samples 
using the DNeasy Plant kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) 
after homogenizing samples in extraction buffer using a 
mortar and pestle. The V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA 
universal target was amplified over 30 cycles (95 °C 30 s, 
55 °C 30 s, 72 °C 30 s) using 342F (CTA​CGG​GGG​GCA​
GCAG) and 806R (GAC​TAC​HVGGG​TWT​CTAAT) 
primers [28]. To profile the fungal community, the ITS1 
region was amplified over 30 cycles using ITS1f (CTT​
GGT​CAT​TTA​GAG​GAA​GTAA) and ITS2 (GCT​GCG​
TTC​TTC​ATC​GAT​GC) primers [29]. Each 25 µL amplifi-
cation reaction contained 1X PCR Buffer (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, MA, USA), 2.5  mM ­MgCl2, 0.5  mM dNTPs, 
0.4 µM of each primer and 1U of Platinum Taq polymer-
ase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). For amplifica-
tions from root tissue, peptide nucleic acid (PNA) clamps 
targeting chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences [30] 
were heated to 60 °C for 10 min and added to the PCR 
mix to a final concentration of 1 µM each. Both extrac-
tion and amplification negative controls containing only 
buffers and water were processed and sequenced along 
with experimental samples. Indexed 16S and ITS ampli-
cons were sequenced using 300PE and 250PE cycles of 
Illumina Miseq Chemistry (Illumina, San Diego, CA, 
USA).
DNA sequencing reads were processed with Cutadapt 
(v.2.8) [31] to remove amplification primer sequences 
and trim bases with a quality score < Q30. Forward 
and reverse sequencing reads were then merged using 
FLASH2 (v.2.2) [32] and amplicon sequence variants 
(ASVs) for both 16S and ITS targets were identified using 
the q2-DADA2 [33] plugin for QIIME2 (v.2020.2) [34]. 
Taxonomic classification of the 16S and ITS ASVs was 
done by Naïve Bayes Classification using the q2-classifier 
in QIIME2 and the SILVA (released 2019/12/1) [35] and 
Unite (released 2020/02/04) [36] reference sets respec-
tively. All ASVs less than 350 bp (16S) and 100 bp (ITS) 
were considered to be less than full length and removed. 
Additionally, all ASVs occurring in fewer than 5 samples 
as well as any 16S ASVs that were classified as mitochon-
drial or chloroplast sequences were removed.
Quantitative PCR
qPCR was used to validate differential read abundance 
profiles for taxa identified through sequencing, and pro-
vide tools to measure the presence and abundance of 
particular ASV in other soil samples. Accordingly, a mul-
tiplex quantitative PCR assay targeting nucleotide differ-
ences in the ITS1 region was used to enumerate fungal 
taxa ASVd3f1 and ASVf509 in genomic DNA samples 
from root, rhizosphere and soil. Primers common to the 
ITS1 region of both sequences as well as ASV-specific 
Taqman probes were designed using Primer3. Each mul-
tiplex reaction contained 1X Ssofast Universal Probes 
Master Mix (Biorad, CA, USA), 0.3 µM of each primer, 
0.2 µM of each TaqMan probe and 2 µL of genomic DNA. 
Both d3f1 and f509 targets were simultaneously amplified 
in a multiplex reaction over 40 cycles (95 °C 30 s, 55 °C 
30 s, 72 °C 30 s). Primer and probe sequences are pro-
vided in Additional file 1. Prior to application to soil sam-
ples, the qPCR probes were evaluated to ensure that no 
cross-reactivity was observed using each of the cloned O. 
brassicae ITS sequences. Each probe detected only the 
targeted ASV to the exclusion of the other, closely related 
target ASV (Additional file  1). Plasmids containing the 
ITS1 sequence for each strain were used as standards to 
calculate the number of ITS gene copies per gram of soil 
or root tissue. The relationship between the abundance of 
O. brassicae and yield was tested using Spearman’s rank-
order correlation (ρ).
Statistical methods
Soil nutrient fluxes, root exudates and crop agronomic 
performance indicators were analysed by MANOVA 
Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate correction and 
post-hoc significance evaluated with Tukey tests using 
the ‘stats’ and ‘multcomp’ packages in R. Principal com-
ponents analysis (PCA) was done using the FactoMineR 
package [37]. Microbial community diversity statistics 
including Bray–Curtis dissimilarity and Shannon diver-
sity were calculated after rarefaction to the smallest 
library size (5000 reads per sample) with the ‘phyloseq’ 
[38] and ‘vegan’ [39] packages in R. Differences in alpha 
and beta diversity were tested for significance using the 
Kruskal–Wallis test (Benjamini–Hochberg false discov-
ery rate correction) and permutational multivariate anal-
ysis of variance (PERMANOVA) respectively. Indicator 
species analysis was conducted using the ‘indicspecies’ 
package and ASVs that were significantly associated with 
canola intensity (specificity ‘A’ and sensitivity ‘B’ ≥ 0.7, 
p value ≤ 0.05) at a each site in at least one sample type 
across both 2018 and 2019 were retained. Differential 
abundance analysis was calculated using centred log-
ratio transformed abundance data with the ‘ALDEx2’ [40] 
package in R. Differentially abundant taxa were identified

as having an effect size ≥ 1 and a Benjamini–Hochberg 
adjusted p value ≤ 0.05 across samples from both 2018 
and 2019.
Results
Soil nutrient fluxes
The effect of crop rotation on soil nutrient fluxes was var-
iable depending on the field site and sampling year. Prin-
cipal component analysis (PCA) of the PRS data showed 
that at Swift Current, canola intensity was associated 
with significant differences in soil nutrient flux pro-
files before and during peak flowering in both the 2018 
and 2019 growing seasons (Table 1). At both Scott and 
Lacombe, differences were observed only at single time 
points in 2019; before flowering at Scott and during peak 
flowering at Lacombe (Table  1). Cultivar selection was 
not associated with significant differences in soil nutrient 
flux profiles at any site (p > 0.05, Additional file 2).
In terms of soil nutrient fluxes for specific macro- and 
micronutrients, Swift Current saw an increase in K fluxes 
from continuous canola in both growing seasons, and an 
increase in soil S in 2018 (Fig. 1). ­NO3 fluxes were higher 
in the C-P-B rotation in 2018 however in 2019, they were 
higher in the monocropped canola (Fig. 1). Both Mg and 
Ca were significantly lower in C-W compared to both 
monocropped canola and C-P-B in 2018 at the early and 
peak flowering time points. In 2019 at Scott, diverse rota-
tion was associated with significant differences in P and 
Fe while at Lacombe, significant differences in ­NO3 and K 
were associated with rotation (Fig. 1). No significant dif-
ferences were found between rotations for ­NH4, Mn, B or 
Al and Cd, Zn, B, Cu and Pb were consistently below the 
limit of detection (Additional file 2).
Agronomic performance indicators
Significant differences in soil moisture, crop yield, oil 
and protein content were restricted to only some sites in 
some years. At Swift Current in 2019, soil moisture, yield 
and oil content were all higher in C-P-B canola while pro-
tein content was lower. Yield was also significantly higher 
in C-P-B canola at Lacombe in 2019, but no difference 
was observed at Scott (Table 2, Additional file 3). There 
was a general trend of higher oil content in C-P-B canola 
at both Scott and Lacombe, however the increases were 
not statistically significant (Table  2, Additional file  3). 
Disease surveys showed that both the incidence and 
severity of Blackleg symptoms were significantly higher 
in C-C canola at all sites, however the average inci-
dence in C-C canola at Swift current was only 21 ± 9.9% 
across both growing seasons compared to 67 ± 16.0% in 
Scott and 83 ± 14.7% in Lacombe (Table 3). Symptoms of 
Alternaria black spot on seed pods were detected only 
at Lacombe in 2019 and were also significantly higher 
in C-C (9 ± 5.4%) compared to both C-W (5 ± 1.4%) and 
C-P-B (4 ± 1.3%) (Table 2, Additional file 3).
Root exudate secretion
Principal component analysis (PCA) of the root exu-
date data showed that at Lacombe, canola intensity, but 
not cultivar selection, was associated with significant 
differences in overall root exudate composition (PER-
MANOVA, F = 5.024, p = 0.002), while there were no sig-
nificant differences found at either Swift Current or Scott 
(Additional file 4).
At Swift Current, tartarate was significantly higher 
in the root exudates from the C-P-B rotation while for-
mate was significantly higher in monocropped canola. At 
Lacombe, tartarate, formate and oxalate were all signifi-
cantly higher in monocropped canola compared to either

C-W or C-P-B (Table 3). There were no significant differ-
ences between rotations observed in samples from Scott.
Microbial community composition
Alpha diversity analysis showed no consistent effects of 
rotation on bacterial or fungal diversity across sample 
types or sites (Fig.  2). At Lacombe and Swift Current, 
only the bulk soil bacterial community showed a signifi-
cant decrease in the Shannon Index for C-P-B compared 
to C-C and C-W. By contrast, the fungal community was 
significantly more diverse in the C-P-B rhizosphere sam-
ples at Swift Current and the rhizosphere and root at 
Scott, although only in 2018 (Fig. 2).
Beta diversity analysis revealed that the effects of 
crop rotation on bacterial community composition 
were variable depending on the year and study site, 
while fungal community composition was significantly 
affected across all sites in the soil, rhizosphere and 
root in both years (Table  4). PERMANOVA analysis 
of the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity metric also indicated 
that the effect of crop rotation on the fungal commu-
nity was greater compared to the bacterial community, 
especially in samples from the root and rhizosphere, at 
all sites (Table 4). Generally, cultivar selection was not 
associated with significant changes in bacterial or fun-
gal community composition with the exception of the 
bacterial community in root samples from Lacombe, 
although the effect was small (PERMANOVA, F = 1.32, 
p = 0.03) (Additional file 5).
Indicator species analysis identified several ASV 
sequences that were consistently associated with spe-
cific rotation strategies in at least one sample type (bulk 
soil, rhizosphere or root) in both 2018 and 2019 (Fig. 3, 
Additional file 6). Across all three sites, there were more 
fungal ASVs (69) identified as indicator species compared 
to bacterial ASVs (21). The majority of bacterial indicator 
ASVs identified were from root samples (15/21) and clas-
sified as Actinobacteria (3), Bacteroidota (5) and Proteo-
bacteria (9), however none were consistent across more 
than one site (Fig. 3, Additional file 6). Roots from C-C 
samples were associated with multiple Flavobacterium 
spp. at Lacombe and multiple Actinobacteria at Scott 
and Swift Current including Streptomyces, Microbacte-
riaceae and Micromonosporaceae. Root samples from 
the C-P-B rotation at Scott were significantly associated 
with abundant bacterial ASVs classified as Serratia and 
Pseudomonas, comprising a mean of 3.0% and 3.3% of the 
total sequences respectively (Fig. 3B).

While the majority of bacterial indicator ASVs were 
root-associated, the majority of fungal indicator ASVs 
were found in bulk soil samples (52/69). Several indica-
tor ASVs were associated with specific rotations at multi-
ple sites including Leptosphaeria and Tetracladium with 
C-C, Parastagonospora with C-W and Penicillium, Volu-
tella, Bipolaris and Sarocladium with C-P-B (Fig. 4). Sev-
eral of the fungal ASV that were strongly associated with 
C-C are known phytopathogens, including Alternaria, 
Leptosphaeria, and Phaeomycocentrospora (Fig.  4). At 
Swift Current, Fusarium spp. were identified as indicator 
taxa in the soil and rhizosphere for both C-C and C-P-B 
however the sequence in C-C was a closer match to 
Fusarium domesticum (96.5%) while the one from C-P-B 
was a closer match to Fusarium solani (96.5%). The 
majority of indicator ASV associated with C-P-B at Swift 
Current (5/9) and Lacombe (5/11) were Sordariomy-
cetes, while at Scott indicator taxa also included multiple

Leotiomycetes (3/20) and Eurotiomycetes (5/20). One 
particularly abundant Eurotiomycetes sequence, clas-
sified as Chaetothyriaceae, was significantly associated 
with C-P-B in the soil, rhizosphere and root at Scott with 
corresponding mean sequence abundances of 1.7%, 2.2% 
and 5.4% respectively.
Two sequences closely related to Olpidium brassicae 
were hyper-abundant in root samples at all three sites, 
with Olpidium spp. accounting for 41–99% of the ITS 
sequencing libraries (Fig.  4). While samples from Swift 
Current and Scott were dominated by only one of these 
sequences (ASVd3f1), samples from Lacombe contained 
two O. brassicae sequences, ASVd3f1 and ASVf509, 
with ASVf509 significantly associated with soil, rhizos-
phere and root samples from C-C (Fig. 4A). ASV-specific 
quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that O. brassicae 
ASVf509 was significantly more abundant in the root, 
rhizosphere and soil in samples from monocropped 
compared to rotation canola at Lacombe (Fig.  5), but 
was only rarely detected in samples from either Scott or 
Swift Current. The abundance of strain ASVd3f1 in root 
samples correlated negatively to yield at only Swift Cur-
rent in 2019 (ρ =  − 0.52, p < 0.01) while strain ASVf509 
correlated negatively to yield at Lacombe in both 2018 
(ρ =  − 0.41, p < 0.05) and 2019 (ρ =  − 0.47, p < 0.05) (Addi-
tional file 7).
Differential abundance analysis using ALDEx2 also 
identified several fungal Orders that were significantly 
more abundant (ALDEx2 effect size > 1, p.adj ≤ 0.05) in 
rotation canola in multiple sample types across all sites. 
In contrast, no differentially abundant bacterial Orders 
were identified (Additional file  8). Among the differen-
tially abundant fungal Orders, Xylariales were signifi-
cantly more abundant in the soil, root and rhizosphere 
of rotation canola at both Scott and Swift Current, but 
this was not the case at Lacombe. Taxonomic Orders

continuous canola (C-C) soils were Glomerellales at Scott 
and Melanosporales at Swift Current.
Discussion
The effects of rotation on soil moisture, nutrient fluxes 
and agronomic performance varied depending on the site 
and year. Swift Current, which was the most arid of the 
three locations, saw the most benefit from higher diver-
sity rotations including increases in yield, oil content, 
and soil moisture in 2019. At Lacombe and Scott, where 
available soil moisture was higher, differences in protein 
and oil content were not significant, and an increase in 
yield was only observed in C-P-B canola at Lacombe in 
2019. These observations suggest it was more likely soil 
and environmental factors like precipitation that led to 
the differences in nutrient fluxes that were observed, as 
opposed to differences in the amount of available bio-
mass or microbiome composition. The addition of rota-
tion–specific fertilizer each year likely helped to ensure 
adequate nutrient availability for crop growth, providing 
evidence that soil-test based fertilizer application is an 
important tool for managing nutrient supply for short 
rotations.
Canola frequency effects on bacterial community 
diversity and composition in the soil, rhizosphere and 
root were not consistently found at either Scott or 
Lacombe, a phenomenon also observed by Floc’h et al. 
[11] comparing rhizosphere communities in C-C, C-W 
and C-P-B rotations after eight years. At Swift Current, 
shifts in bacterial community composition were observed 
in all but one instance, indicating that crop rotation may 
be most impactful for soil bacteria in this soil zone and 
under arid conditions.
Crop rotation was associated with a much larger effect 
on the fungal community of soil, rhizosphere and root 
with significant changes in composition observed in 
all sample types at all sites. Kracmarova et al. [41] also 
observed a more pronounced effect of long-term crop 
rotation (potato, winter wheat, and spring barley) on soil 
fungal communities compared to the bacterial microbi-
ota. Rotations of rice and canola were also determined to 
result in increased soil microbial diversity, and the key-
stone taxa identified in these rotations were all fungal 
genera [42]. In the case of canola, the stronger impact of 
crop rotation on the fungal community may be related to 
the fact that canola is a non-mycorrhizal crop [43] and 
thus with increasing canola frequency there will be a 
selective pressure on these important symbionts. Indeed, 
the relative abundance of Glomerales and Paraglom-
erales was lower in C-C soil, a finding consistent with 
previous research quantifying the effects of canola inten-
sity on AMF diversity in soil [18]. The fungi that were

consistently associated with monocropping are known 
pathogens of canola including Alternaria, Leptosphaeria 
and Phaeomycocentrospora. Disease assessments con-
firmed higher incidence of Blackleg symptoms in C-C 
canola at all sites, a finding in line with previous observa-
tions of increased disease pressure in low diversity canola 
systems [2]. Including wheat or barley in the rotation did 
increase the relative abundance of known cereal patho-
gens including Bipolaris, Sarocladium, Parastagonospora 
and Volutella, however rotation canola was also associ-
ated with multiple beneficial microorganisms at all sites. 
Both Pseudomonas and Serratia found in the roots of 
C-P-B canola at Scott as well as Penicillium in the soil and 
rhizosphere of C-P-B canola at Scott and Swift Current, 
have been previously associated with P solubilization in 
soil and benefits to plant growth [44, 45]. In addition, 
Serratia plymuthica isolated from the rhizosphere of var-
ious plant species has been shown to suppress the growth 
of soil-borne pathogens [46]. Dark septate endophytes 
such as Exophiala and Chaetothyriaceae, which were 
found to be enriched in C-P-B canola at Scott, have been 
associated with multiple benefits to crop plants includ-
ing resistance to Verticillium wilt, drought tolerance and 
parasitic activity against nematode eggs [47].

Crop plants exert control over the composition and 
structure of their microbiome by secreting organic com-
pounds from their roots [48]. Of the three sites, the 
Lacombe site had the most pronounced effects on fun-
gal community composition in both the rhizosphere 
and root and was the only location where canola inten-
sity had a significant effect on the root exudate profile. 
This suggests that field location and associated environ-
mental conditions may have exacerbated the microbi-
ome-related effects of low diversity rotations. Given the 
unique pattern of abundance of O. brassicae ASV f509 
in root samples from Lacombe, there exists the possi-
bility of a feedback loop between O. brassicae coloniza-
tion and root exudate secretion with currently unknown 
resulting effects on plant health. O. brassicae is a known 
endophyte of canola and has been previously found in the 
roots and rhizosphere of canola across multiple pedocli-
matic zones in Canada [10, 12]. While not a known path-
ogen, O. brassicae has been previously associated with 
short-rotation canola, has been reported to reduce yield 
at very high infection levels in controlled greenhouse tri-
als [49], and was correlated with yield decline in short 
rotations in a multi-location field study in the United 
Kingdom [50]. In our study, the relationship between O. 
brassicae abundance and reduced yield was dependent 
on both the strain and location. While other members 
of the genus Olpidium, in particular Olpidium virulen-
tis, are known vectors for plant viruses [51], widespread 
reclassification within this genus means the potential of 
O. brassicae to harbour and transmit viruses that may 
impact canola yield requires further investigation. In this 
context, it is germane to note that rhizosphere, root, and 
bulk soil feature very high spatial and temporal diversity 
in virome composition in B. napus, with continuous can-
ola providing a viral “priming” function that results in an 
increase in viral load and species diversity [52]. It is pos-
sible, though unproven, that such priming could be medi-
ated by the selection of various strains of O. brassicae as a 
result of high frequency canola cropping strategies.
Conclusions
We found that the effects of long-term monoculture 
in canola production on soil nutrient fluxes and root 
exudate profiles were largely dependent on field loca-
tion and associated environmental factors. While rota-
tion was consistently associated with changes in fungal 
community composition in root, rhizosphere and bulk 
soil the effect on bacterial community composition 
was smaller and site-specific. Monoculture canola was 
consistently associated with known canola pathogens 
at all sites including Alternaria, Leptosphaeria, and 
Phaeomycocentrospora while soil from canola rotations 
that included wheat or barley were associated with 
higher levels of known cereal pathogens. Canola rota-
tions were also associated with higher levels of poten-
tially beneficial taxa including Pseudomonas, Serratia, 
Penicillium and Chaetothyriaceae, which have been 
previously linked to higher canola yield and were sig-
nificantly associated with C-P-B rotations at multiple 
sites. The fungus O. brassicae was found to be both 
ubiquitous and highly abundant at all sites, with one 
specific strain strongly associated with monoculture 
canola at Lacombe.
By working in this model long-term rotation experi-
ment, we were be able to measure important functional 
responses of the soil and plant microbiome to different 
canola frequencies over the past decade. Agricultural 
management practices such as crop rotation impose 
important changes on soil characteristics that accu-
mulate over time. Identifying the positive and negative 
implications of canola frequency can be beneficial for 
refining the development of agronomic recommenda-
tions for canola production.
