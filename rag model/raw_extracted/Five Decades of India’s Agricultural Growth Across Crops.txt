SUMMARY 
 
This paper has analysed the trends and pattern in agricultural growth and crop output 
growth at the national level, using time series data from 1967-68 to 2020-21 from published 
sources. The area under foodgrains in gross cropped area (GCA) declined by 11.62% mainly 
due to the fall in area under coarse cereals by 16.78% between triennium ending (TE) 1970-
71 and TE 2020-21. There was a definite shift from foodgrains to non-foodgrains, such as 
fruits and vegetables, oilseeds, fiber, and condiments and spices, whose share in both area 
and in value of output has been increasing during the study period. While the contribution 
of cereals declined from 32.46% in TE 1970-1971 to 27.41% in TE 2020-21, the share of fruits 
and vegetables increased considerably from 14.11% to 27.77% during the same period. In TE 
2020-21, fruits and vegetables accounted for the largest share of the total value of crop 
output followed by cereals, oilseeds, fiber and pulses. The study also reveals that 
diversification towards high value crops (HVCs) offers great scope to enhance farmers’ 
income. The staple crops such as cereals, pulses and oilseeds occupy 77.33% of the GCA but 
contribute only 46.37% of total value of output of crop sector. Interestingly, almost same 
value of output (43.58%) was contributed by HVCs (fruits and vegetables, fibres, 
condiments and spices and sugarcane) which occupy 20.12% of GCA during TE 2020-21. 
These changes in the relative shares of crops in agricultural growth provide a clear 
indication of the growing importance of high-value crops in Indian agriculture. However, 
the long-term growth rate (during 1967-68 to 2020-21) shows that not a single crop 
registered production growth of more than 4.0% per annum. The results of the crop output 
growth model indicate that better irrigation facilities, normal rainfall and improved 
fertilizer consumption will help boost crop output in the country. It may be concluded that 
there is also a need to improve productivity of small and marginal farmers through 
development and implementation of small holding farm technologies. The regenerative 
agriculture through suitable integrated farming system (IFS) models is the need of the hour 
to improve soil health, make agriculture profitable and sustainable in the long run. Crop 
diversification towards oilseeds, pulses and horticulture needs to be given priority by 
addressing the core issues of irrigation, investment, credit and markets in their cultivation. 
While the Government has adopted the use of MSP as signal to encourage crop 
diversification, there is also a need for coordinated action from the State Governments to 
facilitate the shift to high value and less water guzzling crops to enable realization of the 
objective of doubling farmers’ income in a sustainable way.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Over the past seven decades, the Indian economy has undergone a significant structural 
transformation away from agriculture and towards non-agricultural sectors. The share of 
agriculture in the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) has consistently declined, from 
an average 55.12 per cent in 1950-51 to 15.51 per cent in the 2021-22. Despite this rapid 
decline, agriculture continues to be a key sector of the Indian economy because of its 
strategic importance to food security, employment generation, exports and poverty 
reduction. The sector employs close to 49 per cent (Periodic Labour Force Survey, 2020) 
of the country’s total workforce and has been important for poverty reduction, especially 
in the rural areas (Sharma 2011). 
The experiences of developed countries show that the transfer of labour force from 
agriculture to non-agriculture, particularly manufacturing, has promoted production 
growth in agriculture and thus higher income (Gollin et al. 2002). However, India’s 
manufacturing sector witnessed volatile growth and its share in total GVA at basic prices 
has almost remained constant at 18 per cent in the recent times. Further, since the present 
economic growth pattern in the country is driven by the services sector (53.74% share in 
2021-22 at constant prices), labour absorption outside agriculture sector will continue to 
be slow until technical education and skill upgradation in rural area improve 
considerably. 
 
Under these circumstances, higher agricultural growth is critical. It is a matter of concern 
for policy planners, planners and researchers in recent times (Chand et al. 2007; Bhalla 
and Singh 2009; Vaidyanathan 2010). Sustained agricultural growth, which is facilitated 
by constant policy and institutional support, could foretell growth in the rural economy 
and associated secondary activities (e.g., food processing and retail trading). However, 
policy makers in the country have not given enough attention to agriculture-led rural 
industrialization. This is despite the fact that agricultural growth per se was not visible 
during the 1990s (Rao 2003). It is pertinent to note that, the growth performance of 
agriculture was remarkable during the 1980s. In fact, deceleration during the 1990s was 
attributed to the reduction in and/or stagnation of public expenditure on agricultural 
infrastructure, defunct extension services, and biased economic reforms (Mahendra Dev, 
2022                                                                      Vinod Kumar

2000). The first two decades of the twenty first century has shown the remarkable 
agriculture growth, particularly during COVID-19 period when other sectors of the 
economy contracted. This can be largely attributed to the renewed policy thrust from the 
government (since 2005) to revive agricultural growth through various development 
programmes,  such as are Interest Subvention on crop loans and interest subvention on 
prompt repayment, National Food Security Mission, the National Agriculture 
Development Programme (Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana), Pulses Development 
Programme, E-NAM, National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture, Pradhan Mantri 
Krishi SinchaiYojana, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima 
Yojana, Gramin Bahndaran Yojana, Livestock Insurance Scheme, Micro Irrigation Fund, 
PM-Kisan, Soil Health Card (SHC) Scheme, Agricultural Export Policy-2018, Agri 
Startups, KCC scheme extended to animal husbandry and fishery farmers, Kisan 
Sampada Yojana, Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture, Agriculture 
Infrastructure Fund, National Mission on Oilseeds and Oilpalm, Promotion of Farmer 
Producers Organisations, National Project on Organic Farming and MSP at levels of one 
and half times of the cost of production of 23 major crops, etc. Implementation of these 
programmes has contributed to agricultural growth and augmented farmers’ income in 
the country while allowing state governments to better leverage and allocate resources to 
the priority areas of development.  
In recent times, trends in India’s agricultural growth are relatively well researched 
themes. Systematic efforts have been made to examine crop output growth and its 
elements through decomposition analysis (Joshi et al. 2006). The present paper is likely 
to contributes to the existing knowledge on Indian agriculture by estimating crop output 
growth through econometric methods. It also discusses the trends in agricultural growth 
at national levels. 
 
DATA AND METHODOLOGY 
 
The present study is based on the secondary data compiled from various published 
sources. Data on area, production and yield were collected from the Directorate of 
Economics and Statistics (DES), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare. Data were 
collected for major crops for the period 1968-69 to 2020-21. The study period has been 
divided into five phases, viz., early green revolution (1967-68 to 1980-81), mature green

revolution (1981-82 to 1990-91), early economic reforms (1991-92 to 2000-01), economic 
reforms (2001-02 to 2020-21) and overall period (1967-68 to 2020-21). Compound 
annual growth rates (CAGR) have been calculated by using the semi-log method. State-
wise and agriculture and allied sector data on value of crop output were compiled from 
the National Statistical Office, MoSPI, Government of India. Data on Agricultural Gross 
Value Added (AgGVA), value of output from agriculture and allied sector and capital 
formation in agriculture and allied sector were compiled from National Accounts 
Statistics, MoSPI and Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, MoAFW, GoI.  For trend analysis, 
three years’ average (triennium ending) of different variables were calculated to even out 
the inter-year fluctuations and then presented.  
 
Crop Output Growth Model 
 
The growth performance of the crop sector is influenced by several factors such as use of 
physical inputs by farmers, markets, irrigation, credit availability, weather conditions and 
government policies. It is difficult to analyse the effect of all the variables in a simple 
framework because these variables affect crop output through various mechanisms. 
However, an attempt has been made here to examine the determinants of aggregate 
growth of crop output at the national level through the neo-classical growth model, which 
is described as follows. 
 
The aggregate production function can be specified as 
 
Y = F (F, K, R, CI, IRR) ............................. (1) 
 
Where Y is the aggregate crop output value (2011-12 prices), F is fertiliser consumption, 
IRR is the gross irrigated area, CI is cropping intensity and R is the rainfall.  
 
The basis for the inclusion of rainfall in the production function is that a significant 
proportion of cultivated area depends on rainfall and its variation affects crop output 
substantially. Similarly, as the net sown area remains more or less constant over time 
during the study period, cropping intensity is taken as proxy for land. The gross irrigated 
area represents use of water from all sources of irrigation for crop production. Gross 
capital formation in agriculture is considered as agricultural capital (2011-12 prices).

Assuming the Cobb-Douglas Production Function and taking differentiation of equation 
(1), the following equation is obtained. 
 
∆Yt = ß0 + ß1∆Ft + ß2∆Kt + ß3∆IRRt + ß4∆CI + ß5∆R + ei 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Trends in Gross State Domestic Product and Agricultural Gross Value 
Added 
 
The share of Agricultural Gross Value Added (AgGVA) in gross state domestic product 
(GSDP) during 2011-12 to 2019-20 have continuously decreased in all states except in 
Manipur and Meghalaya. The GSDP at constant prices has been grew at compound annual 
growth rate (CAGR) of 6.03 per cent per annum during 2011-12 to 2019-20, which has 
given a positive signal regarding the economic growth of the states. Out of 29 states, while 
CAGR of 20 states are grew more than the national average, CAGR of rest of the states 
were still at less than 6 per cent (Table 1). During 2011-12 to 2019-20, the agricultural 
gross value added (AgGVA) in the country showed an increasing trend and grew at the 
rate of 3.63 per cent per annum, which, though appreciable is still below the target of 4 
per cent set by the India's policymakers. Further, the trend in agricultural growth differs 
significantly (-15.74% in Chhattisgarh to 8.53% in Maharashtra) across the states. While 
4 states, viz., Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Telangana have agricultural growth 
rates more than the national average, the rest of the states have shown less than 3.5 per 
cent growth in AgGVA. Interestingly, states like Kerala (5.72%), Maharashtra (8.53%), 
Rajasthan (6.81%) and Telangana (5.90%) have shown an impressive performance in 
terms of agricultural growth rate, However, the progress of these states are not reflected 
in terms of percentage share of AgGVA in GSDP in 2019-20 (4-12%). 
 
Some of the major states like Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Tamil 
Nadu though displaying steady growth for the entire state economy, have failed to achieve 
even 3 per cent growth in agriculture and it is a cause of concern. The agricultural sector 
in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, 
2022                                                        Agricultural Growth                                                                        6 
 
Karnataka, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh needs special attention as their growth rates are 
negative.

Share of Agriculture Sector in Total GVA  
The share of agriculture, forestry & fishing sectors in total GVA at 2011-12 basic prices has 
seen a steady decrease over the years from 18.53 per cent in 2011-12 to 16.27 per cent in 
2020-21, growing with Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 3.63 per cent. The 
decline was mainly due to the decline in the share of crops in AgGVA from 65.39 per cent 
in 2011-12 to 55.06 per cent in 2020-21. The share of the fisheries in AgGVA has increased 
to 6.72 per cent in 2020-21 from 4.53 per cent in 2011-12. The share of the livestock in 
AgGVA has also increased significantly from 21.79 per cent in 2011-12 to 30.13 per cent 
2020-21. The share of forestry & logging has remained constant at about 8 per cent during 
the entire period (Table 2). The livestock and fishing sectors have grown at a CAGR of 
7.66 per cent and 8.90 per cent over the last ten years ending 2020-21. Development of 
livestock sector has led to the improvement in per capita availability of milk, eggs and 
meat. 
The Gross Value of Output (GVO) at constant (2011-12) prices of the four main sub-
sectors, namely crop, livestock, forestry and logging and fishing and aquaculture which 
together are called as agriculture and allied sectors are presented in Table 3. It may be 
observed that the crops sub-sector which had accounted for 62.44 per cent of the 
agriculture and allied sectors in 2011-12, consistently declined to 55.05 per cent in 2020-
21. The GVO of livestock sector increased steadily from 25.56 per cent in 2011-12 to 30.98 
per cent in 2020-21. During this period, the output of milk, meat and eggs also recorded 
an increasing trend. The share of milk, meat and eggs in output of livestock sub-sector 
was 66.71 per cent, 23.12 per cent and 3.57 per cent, respectively in 2020-21, compared 
to 67.20 per cent, 19.73 per cent and 3.41 per cent, respectively in the base year 2011-12. 
The output of fishing and aquaculture sub-sector increased steadily from about Rs.80105 
crore in 2011-12 to Rs.162449 crore in 2020-21. In percentage terms, the output of fishing 
and aquaculture sub-sector has increased from 4.20 per cent in 2011-12 to 6.30 per cent 
in 2020-21. However, the share of inland fisheries decreased from 57.65 per cent to 51.45 
per cent during the period 2011-12 to 2020-21. The share of value of output of forestry 
and logging is remained constant at around 8 per cent during the period.

Investment in Agriculture and Allied Sectors 
Investment is critical to the sustained growth of any sector.  The Gross Capital Formation 
(GCF) in agriculture and allied sectors relative to AgGVA in the sector has been showing 
a fluctuating trend as shown in Table 4. Fluctuation in the GCF in the sector arises mainly 
because of wide fluctuations in private investment in agriculture and allied sectors. As 
may be observed from the table, while public investment has remained stable between 2-
3 per cent during 2011-12 to 2020-21, the private investment has fluctuated and the total 
agricultural GCF has moved in sync with variation in private investment. Recognising that 
there exists a direct correlation between capital investments in agriculture and its growth 
rate, there should be a focused and targeted approach to ensure higher public and private 
investment in the sector. Higher access to concessional institutional credit to farmers and 
greater participation of private corporate sector, whose investment rates are currently as 
low as 2 to 3 per cent in agriculture (Report on Doubling of Farmers' Income, 2018), may 
help in improving private investment in agriculture. Private corporate investments need 
to be roped in by offering appropriate policy framework coupled with increase in public 
investment in the entire agricultural value system. Further, Gross Capital Formation 
(GCF) in agriculture and allied sectors relative to AgGVA has been showing a fluctuating 
trend from 14.70 per cent in 2015-16 to 15.94 per cent in 2020-21. The GCF in agriculture 
and allied sectors in absolute terms increased from Rs.237648 crore in 2015-16 to 
Rs.326533 crore in 2020-21 at 2011-12 prices. Further, public investment in and for 
agriculture have remained low as only 2.28 per cent of AgGVA at constant (2011-12) prices 
is spent for infrastructure development in agriculture in 2020-21. This must be raised to 
4 per cent as recommended by the high empowered committee (GoI, 2007). That a deficit 
in public expenditure on agricultural infrastructure and extension services substantially 
contributed to the slowdown in agricultural growth has been pointed out by studies such 
as Mahendra Dev (2000), Vyas (2001), Rao (2003) and Chand and Kumar (2004). 
 
Ensuring steady investment in agriculture is crucial to ensure that quality inputs are made 
available for agriculture production while also addressing the infrastructural bottlenecks. 
Quality seed and optimum use of fertilisers are important pillars of growth in agricultural 
productivity. It is also observed that a steady supply of electricity to agriculture brings 
economic efficiency in production. Supply adequate and quality power (electricity) to 
2022                                                        Agricultural Growth                                                                        10 
 
agriculture sector is very low in most of states. These three inputs should be promoted 
appropriately to raise output and farmers' income.

Changes in Cropping Pattern at All India Level 
The cropping pattern in India has undergone significant changes over time. As the 
cultivated area remains more or less constant, the increased demand for food due to 
increase in population and urbanisation and change in food habits puts agricultural land 
under stress resulting in crop intensification and substitution of food crops with high 
value commercial crops. In fact, it is remarkable to observe that area under foodgrains in 
gross cropped area (GCA) declined by 11.62 per cent mainly due to fall in area under 
coarse cereals by 16.78 per cent between triennium ending (TE) 1970-71 and TE 2020-21 
(Table 5). Wheat has gained importance with area allocation of only 10.42 per cent in TE 
1970-71, and it steadily increased to 15.45 per cent in TE 2020-21. Area under rice 
remained more or less constant during the period under study. Interestingly, area lost by 
foodgrains was used for the cultivation of oilseeds, fruits and vegetables and non-food 
crops to the extent of 3.67 per cent, 6.40 per cent and 3.79 per cent, respectively, between 
TE 1970-71 and TE 2020-21. Although the shift from coarse cereals to high value crops is 
likely to increase farm output and income to farmers, in rainfed areas it will expose

Changes in Cropping Area at All India Level 
Increase in area under total oilseeds is not reflective of general rise in area across all 
oilseed crops, but seemed to be limited only to rapeseed and mustard and soybean. The 
Technology Mission on Oilseeds launched in 1986 coupled with price support and 
favourable market conditions for refined oil and protein-rich soya food encouraged the 
shift in the area towards oilseeds. The area under groundnut came down from 4.42 per 
cent in TE 1970-71 to 2.62 per cent in TE 2020-21. However, the area under commercial 
crops like cotton and sugarcane registered significant increase from 4.70 per cent to 6.55 
per cent and from 1.62 per cent to 2.43 per cent during TE 1970-71 to TE 2020-21, 
respectively. Assured prices by Cooperatives and Sugar mills for sugarcane and 
2022                                                        Agricultural Growth                                                                        12 
 
guaranteed price for cotton through the government's monopoly procurement scheme 
encourage the production of these crops while various schemes announced by the 
National Horticulture Board accelerated the expansion of area under fruits and 
vegetables. 
 
It is quite understandable from the above discussion that high value commercial crops 
are taking the lead in terms of area share. However, it would be interesting to analyse the 
contribution of different crops in total value of output. Besides the level of physical output, 
this will also capture the producer price of various crops in the country. Among crop 
groups, fruits and vegetables accounted for the largest share of total value of crop output 
followed by cereals, oilseeds, fiber and pulses in TE 2020-21 (Table 6). While the 
contribution of cereals declined from 32.46 per cent in TE 1970-1971 to 27.41 per cent in 
TE 2020-21, the share of fruits and vegetables increased considerably from 14.11 per cent 
to 27.77 per cent during the same period. The change in share was determined largely by 
commodity price, which rose proportionately higher for fruits and vegetables than cereals 
in the recent decade (Chand et al. 2011). The growth in the horticultural sector has been 
largely demand-driven and has been facilitated by improvements in roads, 
transportation, communication, and electricity (Joshi et al. 2004) and the development 
of retail chains that could establish linkages with farmers for procurement of their crops 
through institutions such as contract farming and producers’ organizations (Birthal, 
Joshi, and Gulati 2005; Roy and Thorat 2008). Further, to cater to the rising demand for 
horticultural products without importing as much, the government of India has been 
promoting the horticultural sector by establishing the National Horticulture Board (NHB) 
in 1985 and then launching the National Horticulture Mission (NHM) in 2005.  
 
Changes in Crop Output at All India Level 
Among individual crops, rice accounted for the major share in the total value of crop 
output but declined from 2000 onwards. Similarly, the value of wheat output reported a 
steady increase until 2000-01 and declined thereafter. Pulses which registered a drop in 
their contribution to the total value of output from 8.39 per cent in TE 1970-1971 to 4.45 
per cent in TE 2010-11, however increased to 5.26 per cent in TE 2020-2021, due to 
significant increase in the MSP of pulses. Meanwhile, the value of output of cotton 
2022                                                                      Vinod Kumar

increased to 5.15 per cent in TE 2020-21 from 3.11 per cent in TE 2000-01. Cotton 
production escalated primarily because of the widespread cultivation of Bt cotton. It was 
found that productivity and profit from cultivation of Bt Cotton is substantially higher 
than the conventional hybrid cotton varieties (Naik et al. 2005). The share of condiments 
and spices in the total value of crop output also increased from 2.17 per cent in TE 1970-
71 to 5.45 per cent in TE2020-21. Overall, data analysis shows that agricultural 
production in the 1980s was broad. However, commercialization of agricultural 
production seems to have gained momentum in the early 1990s. There was a definite shift 
from foodgrains to non-foodgrains such as fruits and vegetables, oilseeds, fiber, and 
condiments and spices, whose share in both area and in value of output has been 
increasing during the study period. Further, the study reveals that diversification towards 
high value crops (HVCs) offers great scope to increase farmers’ income. The staple crops 
such as cereals, pulses and oilseeds occupy 77.33 per cent of the gross cropped area (GCA) 
but contribute only 46.37 per cent of total value of output of crop sector. Interestingly, 
almost same value of output (43.58%) was contributed by HVCs (fruits and vegetables, 
fibres, condiments and spices and sugarcane which occupy 20.12 per cent of GCA during 
TE 2020-21. These changes in the relative shares of crops in agricultural growth provide 
a clear indication of the growing importance of high-value crops in Indian agriculture.

Growth Performance of Major Crops at National Level 
 
It is well documented in the literature that growth in area was the major source of 
production growth until early 1960s (Bhalla and Singh, 2001; Vaidyanathan, 2010). The 
high yielding varieties introduced in wheat and rice during the late Sixties heralded 
India’s green revolution. Along with technology, new institutional structures enabled the 
farmers to adopt improved methods of cultivation. The major changes included provision 
of better irrigation facilities, government procurement system, guaranteed minimum 
support price and supply of inputs at subsidized rates.  As evident from Table 7, wheat 
production registered compound annual growth of 5.48 per cent during the early green 
revolution period (1967-68 to 1980-81). Both yield and area contributed to higher growth 
in production. In the case of rice, growth in yield contributed to production growth of 2.18 
per cent per annum. For foodgrains as a whole, the growth in area and yield were 0.39 
per cent and 1.87 per cent, respectively and resulted in production growth of 2.27 per cent.

2022                                                        Agricultural Growth                                                                        16 
 
However, it is interesting to observe a relatively higher growth in yield of all major crops 
during 1981-82 to 1990-91, i.e., the mature green revolution period. It indicates that crops 
other than rice and wheat shared the technological benefits. With decline in area, 
impressive growth in production of most crops was mainly contributed by growth in yield. 
Rice registered production and yield growth rate of 4.20 per cent and 3.58 per cent, 
respectively. Wheat yield also showed splendid growth of 3.02 per cent. Growth in yield 
of pulses (1.41%) and coarse cereals (2.24%) was significant. However, negative growth  
(-0.19%) was reflected in the decline in area under foodgrains. Despite this, production of 
foodgrains was high at 2.99 per cent, which was contributed by yield growth of 3.18 per 
cent. Oilseeds recorded a growth rate of 5.80 per cent in production and 2.70 per cent in 
yield. This could be attributed to Technology Mission on Oilseeds launched in 1986, which 
laid emphasis on increasing productivity of oilseeds and bridging yield gaps between 
experimental stations and farmers’ fields by adopting improved package of practices. 
Similarly, cotton showed high growth in production by 3.32 per cent and yield by 4.31 per 
cent. However, the impressive growth in crop production observed during the 1981-82 to 
1990-91 was not sustained during the 1990-91 to 2000-01. Growth in the yield of almost 
all crops declined during 1991-92 to 2000-01, i.e., the early economic reforms period. This 
was, in fact, a alarming scenario, which resulted in low growth in crop output. However, 
there was increase in area for rice and wheat during this period. Growth in area under 
sugarcane and cotton increased during this period. Even though recording almost the 
same level of growth in yield, the negative growth in area (-1.60%) resulted in a fall in 
production for coarse cereals. In the case of pulses, the decline in the growth of yield and 
negative growth in area (-0.63) led to fall in production. Consequently, growth in 
foodgrains production declined to 1.91 per cent during the economic reforms period when 
compared to 3.18 per cent in the mature green revolution period. There was significantly 
improvement in production and yield of all most all crops during 2001-02 to 2010-11 and 
2011-12 to 2020-21. Growth in yield of rice increased at 1.60 per cent but very low growth 
in area resulted in sluggish growth in production when compared to the early economic 
reforms period. In contrast, growth in both area and yield of wheat declined. Impressive 
growth in yield of coarse cereals at 3.62 per cent and 3.28 per cent led to 3.10 per cent 
and 2.24 per cent growth in production during 2001-02 to 2010-11 and 2011-12 to 2020-
21, respectively. Groundnut, which witnessed negative growth in area and production in 
2022                                                                      Vinod Kumar

the previous decade (1991-92 to 2000-01), registered growth of 1.95 per cent and 4.74 per 
cent in production due to high growth in yield (2.77% and 4.36%) during 2001-02 to 
2020-21. Thus, impressive growth in groundnut along with rapeseed and mustard led to 
increase in production of oilseeds. Cotton witnessed a whopping growth of 14.20 per cent 
in production as a result of impressive growth of 10.70 per cent in yield during 2001-02 
to 2010-11. The India's policymakers have envisaged an annual growth rate of 4 per cent 
in agriculture and allied sectors since the 9th Five-Year Plan (1996-97 to 2001-02). As the 
crop sector constitutes over three-fourth of total output its growth performance assumes 
great importance in achieving this target. However, the long-term growth rate (during 
1967-68 to 2020-21) shows that not a single crop registered production growth of more 
than 4.0 per cent annum. However, few crops that showed decent growth in production 
were cotton, rapeseed and mustard, wheat and rice. Further, growth in foodgrains 
production was 2.17 per cent, which was only a little higher than the annual population 
growth of 1.64 per cent as per Census 2011. This implies that production of foodgrains has 
to be enhanced to achieve long-term sustainable food and nutritional security in the 
country. It is also noticeable from the long term growth that area shifts have been taking 
place from coarse cereals and oilseeds towards high value crops like sugarcane and the 
more remunerative cotton.  
 
Indian agriculture is dominated by small and marginal farmers (86.21%), who suffer 
serious disadvantage in terms of scale, small farm size discourages many farmers to go 
for diversification of fruits and vegetables mainly because of the price risk and 
uneconomic lot for marketing. Most of the SMF have been facing several major 
constraints such as input supply, credit availability, proper transport, and market facility, 
etc. Their share nearly 60 per cent in total foodgrains production: 49 per cent rice, 40 per 
cent wheat, 29 per cent coarse cereals and 27 per cent pulses as well as over half of the 
country’s fruits and vegetable production, according to Agricultural Census 2015-16. 
Small sized of farmers are also disadvantaged in terms of bargaining power in various 
transactions in the inputs and output markets (Chand, 2017). These constraints can be 
resolved with the promotion of farmer producers organisations (FPOs). SFAC and 
NABARD are promoting FPOs to enable small and marginal farmers to reduce transaction 
costs, access technology, raise bargaining power and integrate with value chains.  
2022                                                        Agricultural Growth                                                                        18 
 
Similarly, policy interventions are required to encourage production of oilseeds and 
coarse cereals. Further, crop productivity has to be improved through better soil and 
water management, profitable crop rotation, innovative marketing and investment in 
farm education and rural infrastructure. Among these factors, the former two are 
essential in ensuring sustainability of agricultural production through effective 
maintenance of soil fertility through balancing use of chemical and organic fertilisers and 
developing drought and pests and diseases varieties. The latter factors are important in 
making agriculture more profitable through efficient marketing, access to and adoption 
of new technologies like artificial intelligence, internet of things, block chain technology, 
agri drone and providing incentives for making on-farm investment.

State-wise Value of output of Agriculture and Allied Sectors at Constant 
(2011-12) Prices for Top Six States   
 
State-wise percentage share of crops, livestock, forestry& logging, fishing & aquaculture 
and total agriculture and allied sectors during the period 2011-12 to 2018-19 for top-6 
States have been presented in Figure 2. Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest output of 
crops in all the years, although its share in all India output has marginally increased from 
12.96 per cent in 2011-12 to 14.05 per cent in 2018-19. The share of Madhya Pradesh has 
gone up considerably from 7.06 per cent in 2011-12 to 10.28 per cent in 2018-19. The 
share of Gujarat in all India output reduced from 8.87 per cent in 2011-12 to 6.84 per cent 
in 2018-19. Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan together accounted for about a quarter of output 
of livestock at constant prices. The output of Tamil Nadu has increased faster during this 
period.  
 
Maharashtra and Rajasthan have together accounted for 25.87 per cent of output of 
forestry and logging. The share of Assam and Uttar Pradesh has decreased during this 
period. West Bengal has reported the increasing output in fishing and aquaculture yet its 
share in all India output has reduced from 24.63 per cent in 2011-12 to 16.39 per cent in 
2018-19. The total share of Assam and Kerala in all India output has reduced in 2018-19 
compared to that in 2011-12. Andhra Pradesh share in all-India output increased 
significantly from 17.74 per cent in 2011-12 to almost 37.52 per cent in 2018-19. The share 
of Assam and Kerala in all India output reduced during these years, although these 
recorded a small increase in value of output.  
 
Among the top 6 states, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh share in the total 
Agriculture and allied sectors has increased from 5.55 per cent and 6.16 per cent in 2011-
12 to 7.97 per cent and 8.09 per cent in 2018-19, respectively.

Crop Output Growth Model 
 
The ordinary least squares (OLS) approach was used to estimate the model, and all the 
variables are in logarithmic form. It may be observed from the model that effect of gross 
irrigated area and rainfall was positive and significant on crop output growth while the 
effect of fertilizer was negative and significant on crop output growth (Table 9). Rainfall 
and gross irrigated area were found to be significant at 1 per cent, while fertiliser was 
significant at 5 per cent level of significance. In the model, the variable cropping intensity 
was not significant. This might be as a result of the more or less fixed nature of cultivated 
land. Additionally, the value of crop output is not considerably impacted by the 
intensification of land use. The regression results model shows that normal rainfall and 
better irrigation facilities have a positive and significant impact while improved fertiliser 
consumption have negative but significant impact on the crop output growth in the 
country.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
There has been significantly changes in the cropping pattern in India with a noticeable 
shift from foodgrains cultivation to commercial and high value crops. Among foodgrains, 
the area for coarse cereals declined by 16.78 per cent between TE 1970- 1971 and TE 2020-
2021 due to the lack of appropriate technological breakthrough. The performance of 
pulses in terms of area and output was not impressive during the study period. However, 
increase in crop yield was a major factor in accelerating crop production in the country 
since the green revolution. High yielding varieties/improved varieties, increased 
irrigation facilities particularly precision irrigation, and adequate and timely availability 
of fertilizers have impressively contributed to higher crop production growth in the 
country. The results of the crop output growth model indicate that better irrigation 
facilities, normal rainfall, and improved fertilizer consumption will help boost crop 
output in the country. 
 
Technology and institutional support for a few crops such as wheat, rapeseed and 
mustard, sugarcane and cotton brought significant changes in crop area and output 
composition in the country. Wheat occupied only 10.42 per cent of GCA in TE 1970-71 
and this increased to 15.45 per cent in TE 2020-21 in the country. The expansion of area 
for wheat, rapeseed and mustard, sugarcane and cotton crops resulted in a reduction of 
area planted to coarse cereals and groundnut. The share of wheat, cotton, fruits and 
vegetables and condiments and spices in the total value of crop output increased from 
6.67 per cent, 3.22 per cent, 14.11 per cent and 2.17 per cent, respectively in TE 1970-71 to 
9.68 per cent, 5.15 per cent, 27.77 per cent and 5.45 per cent, respectively in TE 2020-21. 
Further, the share of rice, coarse cereals and pulses in the total value of crop output has 
decreased from 17.26 per cent, 8.93 per cent and 8.39 per cent, respectively in TE 1970-
71 to 13.96 per cent, 3.78 per cent and 5.26 per cent, respectively in TE 2020-21. The area 
for cotton increased from the 1980s and constituted about 5 per cent of the total value of 
crop output in recent years. Meanwhile, the annual yield growth during 1967-1968 to 
2020- 2021 for major crops was low.

International comparisons based on Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data for 
the year 2019 (Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, 2021) show that yield per hectare of rice 
was 7060 kg in China and 5837 kg in Indonesia against the all-India average of 4058 kg. 
Similarly, the yield of wheat was 5630 kg in China and 7743 kg in France against the all-
India average of 3533 kg. In case of pulses, yield per hectare was 2050 kg in Canada 
against the all-India average of 697 kg only. Hence, there is potential for enhancing the 
yield of major crops through better soil and water management, profitable crop rotation, 
innovative marketing, genetic engineering, and investment in farm education, research 
and development and rural infrastructure. It may be concluded that there is also a need 
to improve productivity of small and marginal farmers through development and 
implementation of small holding farm technologies. The regenerative agriculture through 
suitable integrated farming system (IFS) models is the need of the hour to improve soil 
health, make agriculture profitable and sustainable in the long run. 
 
WAY FORWARD 
 
Crop diversification towards oilseeds, pulses and horticulture needs to be given priority 
by addressing the core issues of irrigation, investment, credit and markets in their 
cultivation. While the Government has adopted the use of MSP as signal to encourage 
crop diversification, there is also a need for coordinated action from the State 
Governments to facilitate the shift to high value and less water guzzling crops to enable 
realization of the objective of doubling farmers’ income in a sustainable way. Research 
shows that every rupee spent on agricultural research and development, yields better 
returns compared to returns on money spent on subsidies or other expenditures on 
inputs. The increase in agriculture research and development (R&D), from the present 
0.65 per cent of GDP to at least one per cent, therefore, may improve productivity in crop 
and allied sectors. Further, integrated farming on small farm holdings – crop, horticulture, 
household dairy, backyard poultry, small pond-culture, and home-grown ducks – will cross-
hold risks and pave the way for farmer doubling his income erelong. Sustainability of 
agricultural growth is assured thus through heavy capital investments in climate resistant 
technologies, cashing in carbon credits sooner than later.
