Abstract
Climate change is an established challenge to global agricultural productivity. This two-year study evaluated the effects of five cropping systems on the
agronomic performance of cotton in the humid tropics. Field trials were carried out during the late cropping seasons (July–December) of 2019 and 2020 on
the Organic Research plot of the Institute of Food Security, Environmental Resources and Agricultural Research, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta,
Nigeria. Five cropping systems: continuous cropping without organic fertilizer (CS1), continuous cropping with organic fertilizer (CS2), crop rotation with
organic fertilizer (CS3), crop rotation without organic fertilizer (CS4), and conventional cropping (CS5) were evaluated in a randomized complete block
design and replicated three times. Sesame and soybeans were the preceding crops. The weather vagaries were described during the cropping seasons. In
2019, cotton plants under CS2, CS3, and CS4 produced significantly (p < 0.05) greater number of bolls per plant (24.3, 23.2, and 22.3), seed weight (16.0, 18.9,
and 19.3 g), and greater seed yield (631.96, 675.08 and 677.88 kg/ha) than did cotton plants under CS1, respectively. A similar trend was recorded in 2020,
except for the number of bolls per plant. Number of rainy days was 53 and 32 in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Prospective cotton growers in the region can
adopt  cotton  production  in  rotation  schemes  that  involve  sesame  and  soybeans  with  (CS3)  or  without  (CS4)  the  application  of  organic  fertilizer  and
continuous  application  of  organic  fertilizer  (CS2).  A  robust  near  real-time  climate  information  service  to  aid  farmers  in  their  production  activities  is
recommended.

Introduction
$
Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is the most widely cultivated fibre crop
on all continents of the world, except for the Antarctic, and is culti-
vated  in  more  than  60  countries[1].  Cotton  fibre  serves  as  a  raw
material for textile industries with an annual economic value worth
more  than  USD 600  billion  and  provides  employment  opportuni-
ties  for  many  people  involved  in  its  value  chain[2].  According  to
FAOSTAT[3], as of 2022, the average production and yield of cotton
in  the  world  and  Africa  stood  at  69,668,142.85  and  4,716,293.5
metric tonnes and 2,216.80 and 957.9 kg/ha, respectively. Organic
cotton accounts for only 1.4% of cotton grown in the world based
on the 2020/21 report of the International Cotton Advisory Commit-
tee (ICAC)[4]. It has been reported that agricultural practices such as
intercropping,  crop  rotation,  the  use  of  compost,  and  FYM  (farm-
yard  manure)  have  been  used  instead  of  agrochemical  inputs  in
organic cotton production[5,6].
Generally, climatic factors (rainfall, number of rainy days, tempe-
rature, relative humidity, sunshine hours, light, and wind) affect the
growth  of  cotton  because  they  interact  with  other  environmental
factors  such  as  nutrient  availability  in  soil,  cultivar,  soil  moisture,
and  agronomic  practices  to  affect  cotton  growth[7,8].  In  recent
decades, climate change has been reported to affect the phenologi-
cal phases of cotton[9,10]. Globally, integrated approaches to reduce
the losses attributable to climate change are being developed while
tackling other traditional challenges to crop production[11,12]. A com-
bination  of  crop  rotation  and  early  warning  systems  (EWS)  were
recently recommended as a highly promising archetype for achie-
ving  the  objectives  of  the  CSA  in  tropical  Africa[13].  The  Early
Warning  System  (EWS)  is  a  general  agricultural  alert  system  that
provides  reliable  and  early  information  on  agricultural  impacts
induced  by  climate  change[14].  It  is  a  system  designed  to  monitor
changes in weather patterns, climate conditions, and environmen-
tal factors that can engender agricultural losses[4]. The system is to
predict and provide timely alerts about adverse agricultural condi-
tions, such as droughts, floods, or pest outbreaks[15]. To achieve this,
it  integrates  satellite-derived  climate  data,  information  from  wea-
ther stations, and predictive models to help farmers make informed
decisions and mitigate risks[16]. Establishing a robust near-real-time
climate information service system together with crop rotation prac-
tices  will  enhance  the  overall  stability  and  productivity  of  cotton
farming in the humid tropics.
Crop  rotation  has  been  described  as  a  veritable  strategy  to
achieve  one  of  the  principles  of  agroecology  aimed  at  enhancing
the  recycling  of  biomass,  optimizing  nutrient  availability,  and
balancing  nutrient  flow[17].  A  recent  study  concluded  that  cotton
demonstrated an increase in yield when planted after soybean due
to  increased  levels  of  soil  N  through  fixation  from  the  preceding
soybean  crop  or  an  alteration  of  soil  microbial  populations  favou-
rable  to  the  succeeding  cotton  crop[18].  Crop  yields  have  been

improved  further  by  introducing  longer  rotations,  such  as  the
addition of a third crop to the rotation, and reported yield increases
attributed  to  greater  residue  diversity  and  improvement  in  soil
conditions[19],  and  alleviation  of  some  of  the  problems  associated
with  no-till[20].  Unfortunately,  the  bulk  of  conventional  cotton  is
produced  under  a  continuous  cropping  system  that  often  records
an increase in the prevalence of soil-borne diseases which is directly
linked to the increase of the pathogen abundance[21] and reduction
in  the  abundance  of  beneficial  soil  organisms  over  time[22],  which
are essential to soil fertility, health, and crop yield. Organic fertilizer
application  to  cotton  can  help  alleviate  some  of  these  problems
because  organically  bound  nutrients  are  held  more  tightly  in  soil
than  nutrients  obtained  from  mineral  fertilizers;  therefore,  their
chances of losses by volatilization and leaching are far less[23].
This study was therefore carried out to determine the agronomic
performance  of  cotton  sown  after  sowing  soybeans  and  sesame
under different cropping systems in an organic crop rotation scheme
under prevailing climatic conditions in a humid tropical location.
 
Materials and methods
 
Study area
The  study  was  conducted  at  the  Organic  Research  Plots  of  the
Institute  of  Food  Security,  Environmental  Resources  and  Agricul-
tural  Research  (IFSERAR)  of  the  Federal  University  of  Agriculture,
Abeokuta  (Nigeria).  The  farm  is  located  within  (7°13'51.17''  N  and
7°13'53.16" N and longitudes 3°23'49.12" E and 3°23'51.86" E, at an
altitude of 131.5 m above sea level). Figure 1 shows a map of the
project area.
 
Growth conditions during the experimental period
The rainfall pattern in the study area is bimodal with two peaks in
July and September and a dry spell in August termed the 'August
break'. However, the two peaks were recorded in June and October
in 2019 and June and September in 2020. During the experimental
period, a total rainfall of 693.1 and 493.3 mm were recorded in 2019
and 2020, respectively. The experiment was carried out during the
late  cropping  seasons  (July−December)  of  2019  and  2020  (Fig.  2).
The textural class of the soils under the cropping systems was loamy
sand, except for the soil under continuous cropping (CS1) without
organic fertilizer which was sandy in both years (Tables 1 & 2). The
pH  of  the  soils  under  the  various  cropping  systems  was  slightly
acidic, especially in 2019 and 2020, all the cropping system soils had
slightly  alkaline  pH  values  with  CS2  and  CS4  having  the  highest
values  of  7.4.  The  nitrogen,  phosphorus,  potassium,  and  organic
carbon  contents  of  the  soils  across  the  cropping  systems  were
generally low in both years (Table 1).
 
Experimental design and treatments
The experiment was performed in a Randomized Complete Block
Design (RCBD) and replicated three times. The five cropping systems
evaluated  were  as  follows:  a.  CS1 - Continuous  cropping  (without
organic fertilizer); b. CS2 - Continuous cropping (with organic fertil-
izer);  c.  CS3 - Rotation  (with  organic  fertilizer);  d.  CS4 - Rotation
(without organic fertilizer); e. CS5 - Conventional system (60 kg N,
56 kg P2O5 and 60 kg K2O and herbicide application).
The  test  varieties  of  the  experimental  crops  were  as  follows:
Cotton - Samcot  11,  an  erect  type,  lobed  land  glanded  leaves,
slightly  conical  bolls,  a  long  staple,  with  a  potential  yield  of  seed
cotton  at  2.5  t/ha,  mean  fibre  length  of  26.5−27.5  mm  and  late
maturing  variety[24];  soybean - TGx  1448-2E,  a  medium  maturing,
pod shattering resistant and high yielding variety[25] and sesame - E-
8 variety, a drought-tolerant, good seed quality, with a 1,000-seed
weight > 3.0 g and high yield[26]. Sowing was performed on July 10,
2019, and July 24, 2020.
 
Soil sampling and analysis
Before  planting  each  year,  soil  samples  were  collected  from  the
experimental field on a cropping system basis for routine soil analy-
sis to determine the physical and chemical properties of the soil.

Crop husbandry
Each  year,  the  experimental  field  was  ploughed  twice  at  two-
week  intervals  and  subsequently  harrowed  one  week  later.  The
crops were sown in their respective plots using the following row
spacings:  soybean - 60  cm  ×  5  cm,  sesame - 60  cm  ×  5  cm,  and
cotton - 90  cm  ×  40  cm.  Weeding  was  performed  at  3,  6,  and  9
weeks  after  sowing  (WAS).  Five  plants  (cotton)  were  randomly
selected and tagged at 5 WAS from the net plot for plant height and
yield attribute measurements on a plot basis. The experiment was
carried out under rain-fed conditions. The organic fertilizer used was
Aleshinloye Grade B (an abattoir-based fertilizer) which was applied
at 3 WAS using the side dressing method at the rate equivalent to
the recommended nitrogen level (60 kg N/ha) while the inorganic
fertilizer  was  applied  to  the  conventional  system  at  3  WAS  at  the
rate of (60 kg N, 56 kg P2O5, and 60 kg K2O). The organic fertilizer
contained 10.96 g/kg N, 0.01 g/kg P, and 6.30 g/kg K in 2019 and
12.30 g/kg N, 3.37 g/kg P, and 2.01 g/kg K in 2020. In 2018 and 2019,
soybean  and  sesame  were  planted  as  preceding  crops  for  cotton
grown in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
 
Data collection
The  rainfall  distribution,  monthly  mean  temperature,  sunshine
hours,  and  relative  humidity  were  used  as  proxies  for  weather
variations. Five plants (cotton) were randomly selected and tagged
at  5  WAS  from  the  net  plot  for  plant  height  and  yield  attribute
measurements on a plot basis. Data were collected on the following
parameters:  plant  height  (cm)  at  harvest  was  measured  as  height
from the soil surface to the apex of the plant, which was measured
with  a  metre  rule;  number  of  sympodia  branches  (primary)  as  the
total  number  of  the  fruiting  branches  which  was  carried  out  by
visual counting; number of monopodia branches (secondary) as the
total number of the vegetative branches which was done by visual
counting;  total  number  of  branches  by  counting  the  number  of
branches per plant and the mean average determined; number of
bolls per plant (NBOLLS) by counting the number of bolls for each
tagged plant at harvest and the average determined; weight (g) of
seed  cotton  per  plant  (SCWT)  was  weighed  after  the  bolls  were
detached from the cotton plant and they contained both the seeds
and the lint; number of seeds per open boll (NSEED), weight (g) of
seeds (SEEDWT) the seeds were weighed after the seeds have been
detached  from  the  lint  from  the  tagged  plants;  weight  (g)  of  lint
(WTLINT)  per  plant  this  was  weighed  after  the  lint  has  been
detached  from  the  seed,  and  cotton  seed  yield  (kg/ha)  was  com-
puted from seed cotton yield per plot and converted to a unit area.
Weighing of all the samples was carried out using a sensitive scale
(ATOM A – 120 with maximum capacity of 10 kg).
 
Statistical analysis
All data collected were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA)
to  test  the  significance  of  the  cropping  system  effects  using  the
MSTATC package[27]. When the cropping system effects were signifi-
cant (p < 0.05), the means were separated using the least significant
difference (LSD) method at the 5% probability level.
 
Results and discussion
 
Weather parameters
The  agronomic  performance  of  crops,  especially  under  rain-fed
conditions, is largely affected by prevailing weather conditions and
water is the major limiting growth resource[28]. The rainfall distribu-
tion  was  more  favourable  in  2019  (693.1  mm)  than  in  2020

(493.3  mm)  as  shown  in Table  3.  The  mean  long-term  (35  years)
average of 632.8 m only compared favourably with the 2019 rainfall
and  the  recommended  water  requirement  of  700–1,300  mm  for
good cotton crops[29]. The number of rainy days recorded in 2019
and  2020  late  cropping  seasons  were  53  and  32  d,  respectively
(Table 3). Water has been reported to be critical to cotton seed and
lint  yield[30].  Moisture  is  most  critical  for  cotton  from  the  square
(flower bud) stage to the first bloom and first boll opening stages.
During  this  critical  period,  cotton  vegetation  growth  is  rapid,  and
the  number  of  potential  fruiting  sites  is  high[29].  In  our  study,  the
critical period occurred approximately 45 d after sowing (DAS), and
the  cotton  plants  were  able  to  escape  the  prolonged  dry  spell  of
August 2020, since sowing was done on July 24, 2020. The begin-
ning  of  the  critical  period  coincided  with  a  wetter  September
(246.3 mm) in 2020 compared with 96.3 mm in 2019. Similarly, the
mean  monthly  temperature  ranges  of  26.2−26.5  °C,  in  2019  and
25.7−28.3 °C, in 2020 compared well with the recommended tem-
perature range of 15–32 °C[7]. At higher temperatures, cotton plants
are likely to experience inhibited photosynthesis[31] and at tempe-
ratures  above  32  °C,  boll  growth  decreases  significantly  and  boll
shedding  can  set  in[32].  However,  these  high-temperature  condi-
tions were not experienced during flowering and boll formation in
our  study.  Sunshine  hours  have  been  reported  as  an  effective
climatic factor during and preceding and succeeding periods of boll
production[33].  In  our  study,  sunshine  hours  recorded  in  2019
(13.6 h) and 2020 (17.7 h) during the late cropping seasons were not
limiting  (Table  3). Figure  3 illustrates  the  coefficient  of  variation
(CV)  of  rainfall  patterns  during  Nigeria's  primary  growing  season
(June−September) for the last 30 years. Most states in Nigeria expe-
rienced CV beyond 10%, meaning there are uncertainties in the rain-
fall patterns. The decade 1991−2000 was remarkably volatile, with
almost the entire country exhibiting CV in the range of 11% to 20%
as indicated in the map. A higher CV indicates more erratic rainfall,
while  a  lower  CV  reflects  a  more  stable  and  consistent  rainfall
pattern within a given period. A location with a CV of 10% suggests
that  erratic  rainfall  occurs  once  every  10  years,  and  a  CV  of  20%
implies that extremities and uncertainties in rainfall are experienced
two out of every five years.
These  rainfall  uncertainties  are  particularly  noticeable  in  the
South-western  region,  during  the  2001  to  2010  period  and  in  the
North-west and North-east regions during 2011 to 2020, where the
CV exceeded 20%. The average number of wet and dry days per year
for all Agro-Ecological Zones in Nigeria during the last three decades
revealed  that  the  Arid/Sahel  (AS)  and  Semi-Arid  (SA)  zones  in  the
north recorded significantly fewer wet days compared to dry days,
making them suitable for growing short-duration crops like millet,
cowpea,  and  sorghum.  Conversely,  the  Humid  Forest  (HF)  and
derived Savanna (DS) zones in the south (which describes the ecol-
ogy of our project site), have slightly more wet days than dry. This
derived  savanna  region  has  consistently  stable  rainy  days  ranging
from 127.5 to 129.1 d over the last four decades compared to other
AEZs (Table 4). The derived Savannah zone should therefore be ideal
for producing fibre crops like cotton.
The connection between adopting a crop rotation system invol-
ving sesame and soybean with organic fertilizer and establishing a
near-real-time  climate  information  service  lies  in  enhancing  the
resilience  and  productivity  of  cotton  production  under  changing
weather conditions. Cotton grows best in rich soils and under opti-
mum weather conditions. Access to virgin land in tropical Africa is a
challenge, hence there is the need to effectively manage the land
used  for  continuous  production.  Since  crop  rotation  and  organic
fertilizer  application  improve  soil  health  and  reduce  pest  and
disease  pressures,  it  is  logical  to  adopt  the  system  for  sustainable
productivity. Meanwhile, the farmers also require clear guidance in
the timing of farming operations, fertilizer application, and harves-
ting dates. Thus, allowing them to adapt more effectively to weather
variability  and  reduce  potential  crop  losses.  A  robust  climate
information  service  is  required  to  provide  timely  information  that
can guide farmers decisions.

Cotton agronomic traits and seed cotton yield
Cotton  plants  tend  to  experience  inhibited  photosynthesis[33],
boll growth decreases significantly, and boll shedding at high tem-
peratures above 32 °C[34]. However, these high-temperature condi-
tions in our study did not affect flowering or boll formation. Simi-
larly, sunshine hours affect boll production[31]. In our study, sunshine
hours  recorded  in  2019  (13.6  h)  and  2020  (17.7  h)  during  the  late
cropping seasons were not limiting (Table 3).
At maturity in 2020, cotton plants under CS2, CS3, and CS5 were
significantly taller than those from CS1 and CS4 (Table 5). This fin-
ding is similar to that of Kumbhar et al.[35], Rochester et al.[36], and
Ndor  et  al.[37] that  the  plant  height  of  cotton  plants  is  related  to
nitrogen  application.  In  both  years,  all  the  cotton  plants  grown
under  CS2,  CS3,  CS5,  or  CS4  produced  more  sympodia  branches
than the cotton under CS1. A similar trend was reported for cotton
grown in legume rotation with nitrogen application[35]. The number
of bolls per plant increased in response to the application of ferti-
lizer (CS2, CS3, and CS5) and crop rotation (CS4) in 2019. Apparently,
the applied fertilizers and nutrients from the preceding soybean in
2018 enhanced the production of fruiting bolls by the plants. Earlier
reports  have  shown  an  increased  number  of  bolls  per  plant  follo-
wing the application of nitrogen fertilizer and the incorporation of
preceding  legume  crops[38] and  cotton  sown  after  soybean  in  a
soybean,  corn,  and  cotton  rotation[18].  Similarly,  Ndor  et  al.[37]
reported  a  linear  increase  in  the  number  of  bolls  per  plant  as  the
nitrogen application rate increased from 30 to 90 kg in the southern
Guinea savannah in Nigeria.
In our study, CS3 and CS4 increased the seed cotton weight per
plant in both years (Table 6). This could be attributed to the signifi-
cant role played by nitrogen in enhancing the photosynthetic acti-
vity of the plants and the partitioning of photosynthates from the
leaves to the seeds of cotton plants grown on CS2, CS3, and CS4.
The  slow  release  of  nutrients  by  the  organic  fertilizer  and  crop
residues  incorporated  into  the  soil  could  have  contributed  to  the
observed  trend  as  suggested  by  Pettigrew  et  al.[18],  Kumbhar  et
al.[35], and Olowe & Adejuyigbe[17]. The weight of the seeds per plant
of cotton followed a trend similar to that of the seed cotton weight.
Nitrogen  is  crucial  to  cotton  seed  yield[38−40] and  the  cropping
systems  that  received  organic  fertilizer  application  significantly
enhanced  cotton  seed  yield  relative  to  the  CS1  and  CS5  in  both
years. During the wetter year (2019), the seed cotton yield of cotton
plants  under  CS2,  CS3,  and  CS4  ranged  between  631.9  and
677.8 kg/ha (Table 6). However, in 2020, the yield under similar crop-
ping systems ranged between 541.8 and 784.8 kg/ha. These values
are slightly lower than the Nigerian average of 842.8 kg/ha and less
than the African average of 1,044 kg/ha and the global average of
2,137 kg/ha according to FAOSTAT[3]. The markedly high world seed
cotton  yield  could  be  attributed  to  the  inclusion  of  the  yield  of
genetically  modified  organism  (GMO)  cotton  (e.g.  Bt  cotton).  A

seed yield of 3,395 kg/ha of Bt cotton was reported following the
use  of  drip  irrigation  combined  with  bio-fertigation  of  a  liquid
formulation[11].
 
Conclusions
Compared  with  the  continuous  cropping  system  without  ferti-
lizer (CS1), the crop rotation system plus organic fertilizer applica-
tion (CS3), crop rotation without organic fertilizer application (CS4),
and  continuous  cropping  with  organic  fertilizer  application  (CS2)
increased the number of bolls per plant (24.3, 23.2, and 22.3), seed
weight  (16.0,  18.9,  and  19.3  g)  and  greater  seed  yield  (631.96,
675.08, and 677.88 kg/ha) than did cotton plants under CS1, respec-
tively in 2019. A similar trend was recorded in 2020, except for the
number  of  bolls  per  plant.  With  respect  to  climate  variability,
drought  scenarios  were  recorded  in  the  derived  savanna  region
(study  area)  in  both  years  with  wet  days  ranging  from  127.5  to
129.1  d  over  the  last  three  decades.  The  late  cropping  seasons  of
2019  and  2020  recorded  53  and  32  rainy  days,  respectively.  It  is
therefore, recommended that cotton can be cultivated in rotation
schemes involving soybean and sesame with (CS3) or without (CS4)
the application of organic fertilizer and under continuous cropping
with organic fertilizer application (CS2) for enhanced food security
and  soil  sustainability  in  the  forest–savanna  transition  zone  of
Nigeria.  The  cultivation  of  crops  such  as  cotton  on  a  commercial
scale in this agroecological zone will require a robust near real-time
climate information service to guide prospective farmers on when
to grow cotton.
