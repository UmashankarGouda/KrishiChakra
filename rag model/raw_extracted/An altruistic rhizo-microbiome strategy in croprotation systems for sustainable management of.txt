ABSTRACT
Crops leave a soil legacy with altruistic effects for subsequent crops but not for themselves. While research
has focused on improvements in soil physicochemical properties and the suppression of non-host patho-
gens, the altruistic microbiome and its assembly mechanism driven by root exudates remain largely un-
known. Here, we identified altruistic but self-detrimental phenomena when garlic was rotated with other
crops based on meta-analysis and in vivo experiments. Studies utilizing a globally adopted garlic–pepper
rotation system demonstrated density-dependent enrichment of key microbial taxa, especially the Penicil-
lium genus, which supports the healthy growth of non-Allium plants but exhibits pathogenicity toward
garlic. Furthermore, we found that garlic roots stably secrete diallyl disulfide (DADS) into soil, imposing
reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress in the rhizosphere and reshaping the microbial community, particu-
larly suppressing ROS-sensitive pathogens while enriching ROS-tolerant beneficial microorganisms. As a
result, Penicillium allii, with strong oxidative stress tolerance, survives and accumulates in the highly
stressful garlic rhizosphere environment, thereby playing an ‘‘altruistic but self-detrimental’’ role in the
rotation system. In addition, preliminary field experiments showed that co-application of DADS with
P. allii could enhance stable colonization of P. allii, promoting sustainable management of soil-borne dis-
eases and improving yield. In summary, this study reveals that garlic root exudate DADS triggers ROS-
mediated selection pressure, enriching stress-tolerant P. allii and establishing an ‘‘altruistic’’ microbiome
succession mechanism in crop-rotation systems. This mechanism enables targeted soil-borne disease
management through plant-driven microbial community engineering.

INTRODUCTION
Large-scale monoculture has been widely adopted because of its
mechanization efficiency and short-term economic returns
(Mukhovi and Jacobi, 2022). However, long-term intensive
monoculture has been linked to recurrent outbreaks of soil-
borne diseases and excessive fungicide application, raising con-
cerns about food safety and ecological stability (Pe´ rez-Branda´ n
et al., 2014). Such disease outbreaks in monoculture systems
are mainly driven by the accumulation of soil pathogens (Luo
et al., 2021). Among them, soil-borne Phytophthora species
cause annual yield losses ranging from 10% to 100% (Pokou
et al., 2008; Dorrance, 2018). Historically, these pathogens
have contributed to major social and ecological crises, such as
the Irish famine, the decline of woody plants in the Americas,
and
continuing
threats
to
global
soybean
and
pepper
production, thus undermining agricultural sustainability and
farmers’ livelihoods (Kamoun et al., 2015). Although resistant
crop varieties and chemical fungicides are utilized for the
management of soil-borne diseases, their long-term efficacy is
hindered by the rapid evolution of pathogen resistance and fungi-
cide tolerance (Xu et al., 2022; Madhushan et al., 2025). Recent
evidence indicates that soil-borne diseases can be mitigated by
either suppressing pathogens or enriching beneficial microbes

(Wang et al., 2021a; Luo et al., 2021), underscoring the need for
eco-friendly approaches to strengthen soil microbial suppression
of soil-borne pathogens.
Crop rotation is a cost-effective and widely adopted field-man-
agement practice that offers substantial advantages over
monocropping. In monocropping systems, soil progressively be-
comes less suitable for the same crop because of the accumula-
tion of host-specific pathogens (Ostfeld and Keesing, 2012).
In contrast, crop rotation generates positive legacy effects
for subsequent crops through the enrichment of beneficial
microbes and disruption of host–pathogen interactions (Zhou
et al., 2023). This strategy alleviates negative plant–soil feedback
by fostering a healthier soil ecosystem (Wang et al., 2021a). The
rhizosphere microbiome in monoculture systems often displays
‘‘self-detrimental
behavior,’’ where host-specific pathogens
gradually
become
dominant,
reducing
soil
adaptability
to
repeated planting of the same species (Zhou et al., 2023).
However, through appropriate crop matching, crop rotation can
suppress harmful microorganisms, sustain plant diversity, and
drive
dynamic
microbial
community
shifts
in
agricultural
ecosystems (Wang et al., 2021a; Hong et al., 2023). Despite
these advantages, the mechanisms by which crops shape the
assembly of specific rhizosphere microbial communities remain
poorly understood.
Root exudates serve as both nutrients and signaling molecules
that influence microbial growth and aggregation in the rhizo-
sphere (Upadhyay et al., 2022). Allelopathic plants release
phytoalexins, key secondary metabolites in root exudates,
which recruit beneficial microbes and suppress pathogens to
establish a disease-suppressive microbiome that prevents soil-
borne infections (Desmedt et al., 2022). Such microbiomes can
be transmitted to subsequent crops in crop-rotation systems.
However,
certain
microorganisms
(e.g.,
pathogens)
can
overcome phytoalexin-mediated defenses, colonize roots, and
contribute to the soil microbial legacy (Voges et al., 2019; Wen
et al., 2023). Evidence indicates that host-adapted pathogens
can tolerate reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursts generated by
plant defense metabolites, facilitating infection and parasitic in-
teractions (Voges et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2022). Phytoalexins
thus play a dual role in shaping microbial communities,
selectively enriching or suppressing taxa depending on their
ability to metabolize phytoalexins and detoxify ROS (Voges
et
al.,
2019).
Consequently,
an
understanding
of
how
phytoalexins regulate rhizosphere microbiota assembly, and the
related ‘‘altruistic but self-detrimental’’ mechanisms, is critical
for efforts to improve soil health management. Thus far, the role
of phytoalexin-induced ROS in microbial legacy transmission
within crop-rotation systems has not been sufficiently defined.
In this study, we carried out experiments to verify the existence of
microbial altruistic yet self-detrimental behavior in a widely adop-
ted garlic–pepper rotation system and to clarify the microbial as-
sembly mechanisms driven by garlic root exudates. Our results
demonstrated that garlic roots secrete diallyl disulfide (DADS),
which induces ROS stress in the rhizosphere, suppresses the
ROS-sensitive pathogen P. capsici, and enriches ROS-tolerant
Penicillium allii, thereby supporting the growth of non-Allium
crops. Building on this ‘‘altruistic but self-detrimental’’ effect,
we propose an environmentally friendly approach in which exog-
enous DADS is co-applied with P. allii to achieve sustainable
management of soil-borne diseases.
RESULTS
Garlic-conditioned soil benefits the yield and disease
suppression of subsequent crops
Based on a meta-analysis of 21 crop-rotation studies using
garlic as the previous crop, garlic-conditioned soil significantly
boosted the yield of subsequent crops (Figure 1A), particularly
in
Solanaceae
and
Cucurbitaceae
species.
Greenhouse
experiments
confirmed
that
soil
conditioned
by
garlic
significantly
enhanced
the
biomass
of
Solanaceae
crops
(pepper, tobacco, and potato) but not garlic itself (Figure 1B;
Supplemental Figure 1). Disease investigation experiments
(Figure 1C) demonstrated that garlic-conditioned soil enhanced
soil suppressiveness against P. capsici invasion (Figure 1D) and
improved
resistance
in
pepper
stems
against
P.
capsici
infection (Figure 1E; Supplemental Figure 2). Soil suspensions
from a Midu County garlic field (Figure 1F), a Nanhua County
garlic field (Figure 1G), and potted garlic (Figure 1H) exhibited
significantly higher antagonistic activity against P. capsici
mycelial
growth
compared
with
filtered
soil
suspensions,
indicating
microbial
contributions
to
disease
suppression.
Additionally, suspensions from potted garlic-conditioned soil
significantly increased resistance-related metabolites in pepper
shoots (Supplemental Figure 3). In contrast, pepper-conditioned
soil showed no significant inhibitory effect on P. capsici mycelial
growth (Figure 1I).
Penicillium enriched in garlic-conditioned soil
suppresses pepper Phytophthora disease
To examine the role of garlic in the development of disease-
suppressive soil, a greenhouse experiment was conducted using
soils conditioned with increasing garlic planting densities (0, 1, 2,
3, and 5 garlic plants per pot, designated as CK, Z1, Z2, Z3, and
Z5) (Figure 2A). Rhizosphere soils were harvested to assess their
disease-suppressive effects and microbial community changes.
The results showed that garlic-conditioned soils enhanced
pepper resistance to P. capsici infection, with resistance levels
22.03%–60.90% higher than the control, showing the strongest
effect
at
the
highest
planting
density
(Z5)
(Figure
2B;
Supplemental Figure 4). Soil suspensions from these soils
inhibited P. capsici mycelial growth in a density-dependent
manner (Figure 2B).
High-throughput sequencing revealed that garlic planting density
significantly altered soil microbial communities. While bacterial
communities showed no significant structural changes at the
genus level (analysis of similarity, ANOSIM, R = 0.0881, p = 0.
249) or amplicon sequence variant (ASV) level (R = 0.1550, p = 0.
164), fungal communities exhibited significant beta-diversity shifts
(genus level, R = 0.3056, p = 0.043; ASV level, R = 0.3388, p = 0.
011)
(Figure
2C;
Supplemental
Table
1).
The
Bray–Curtis
distance of fungal communities increased along the PCoA1 axis
with garlic density (Figure 2C), negatively correlating with pepper
lesion length (R2 = −0.31, p = 0.01) and positively correlating
with mycelial inhibition (R2 = 0.3, p = 0.01), but not with bacterial
communities (lesion length, R2 = 0.03, p = 0.47; mycelial inhibition,
R2 = 0, p = 1.00) (Figure 2D; Supplemental Figure 5). Further

taxa
revealed
that
ASV1
(Penicillium,
Aspergillaceae) was enriched with garlic density (Figure 2E),
showing a positive correlation with planting density (r = 0.9246,
p < 0.001) and mycelial inhibition (r = 0.5979, p = 0.0053), but a
negative correlation with lesion length (r = −0.6112, p = 0.0042)
(Supplemental Figure 6). Phylogenetically, ASV1 and ASV3062
clustered with P. allii, ASV396 with P. brevicompactum, and
ASV1060 with P. ochrochloron (Supplemental Figure 7).
To validate the role of Penicillium in disease suppression, we iso-
lated three Penicillium species from garlic-conditioned soil: P. allii
(YNAU-Q-6), P. ochrochloron (YNAU-P-4), and P. brevicompac-
tum (YNAU-Q-9). These were identified by morphology and ITS/
β-tubulin amplification (Figure 2F; Supplemental Figure 8). All
three isolates exhibited strong antagonistic activity against the
mycelial
growth
of
P.
capsici
(Figure

Garlic-secreted DADS enriches altruistic Penicillium for
pepper Phytophthora disease suppression
To investigate the role of root exudates in the development
of disease-suppressive soil, we analyzed the chemical composi-
tion of garlic root exudates, pot-grown garlic-conditioned
soil, and field-collected garlic rhizosphere soil using gas chroma-
tography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). DADS emerged as the
most abundant and stable compound across all samples
(Figure 3A; Supplemental Figures 14 and 15; Supplemental
Tables 4–6). In root exudates, DADS constituted 44.39% of the
total volatile organic compounds (Supplemental Table 4), a
dominance mirrored in field rhizosphere soil (39.68% relative
peak area; Supplemental Table 5) and pot-grown garlic-condi-
tioned soil (56.9% relative peak area; Supplemental Table 6;
Supplemental
Figure
15A).
Metabolomic
analysis
further
confirmed DADS as the sole compound with a VIP value >1
(Supplemental
Figure
15B).
Quantitative
analysis
revealed
that DADS concentrations in garlic root exudates increased
with planting density, ranging from 8.96 to 27.39 μM (Figure 3B).
Redundancy analysis revealed that garlic planting density, DADS
concentration in root exudates, and the relative abundance of
Penicillium were significantly negatively correlated with pepper
Phytophthora lesion length but positively correlated with P. cap-
sici mycelial inhibition (Figure 3C). To test the role of DADS in
microbiome assembly and Phytophthora disease suppression,
soils were amended with DADS (0, 13.7, 27.3, 54.7, and 109.
4 μmol kg−1; designated as CK, D1, D2, D3, and D4) and
conditioned for 1 month. All DADS-treated soils significantly
reduced
pepper
blight
lesions
(Figure
3D;
Supplemental
Figure 11) and inhibited P. capsici mycelial growth, with the
strongest
suppression
observed
in
the
D1
treatment
(Figure
3D).
ITS
sequencing
revealed
significant
fungal
community shifts in DADS-treated soils (ANOSIM, p < 0.05;
Supplemental Table 2), with Penicillium enriched at D1–D2
concentrations (Figure 3E). DADS (13.7 μM, corresponding to
the D1 concentration) promoted the growth of culturable
Penicillium strains YNAU-P-4 and YNAU-Q-6 (Figure 3F) but
inhibited
soil-borne
pathogens
(Cylindrocarpon
destructans
YNAU-RS-6 and P. capsici YNAU-501) in a dose-dependent
manner
(Figures
3G
and
3H).
Collectively,
these
results
demonstrate that garlic-derived DADS drives fungal community
assembly, enriches Penicillium, and suppresses pepper Phy-
tophthora disease.

distinct
responses. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of glutathione
metabolism and peroxisome-related pathways (Figure 4A–4C;

further indicated that C. destructans and P. capsici underwent
oxidative stress responses, including cellular detoxification and
redox homeostasis (Figure 4B and 4C; Supplemental Figures 24
and 25), whereas P. allii showed no such enrichment (Figure 4A;
Supplemental Figures 22 and 23).
In P. allii YNAU-Q-6, only a limited number of genes were regu-
lated by DADS, with GST and FSP1 genes showing significant up-
regulation indicative of ROS induction, while strong upregulation
of CYP628 mitigated oxidative stress effects, allowing P. allii
to maintain growth (Figure 4D; Supplemental Figure 17A and
17B). Conversely, both pathogens exhibited extensive oxidative
stress
pathway
signatures.

Both pathogens significantly overexpressed antioxidant genes
(GST and SOD; Figure 4E and 4F) yet downregulated critical
detoxification genes (CYP53A1 in C. destructans; bglX/ABC1 in
P. capsici) and growth-related genes (CHS1/ECHS1 in C. de-

microbial sensitivity to DADS-induced ROS bursts underlie the
observed growth inhibition phenotypes, with P. allii exhibiting
greater oxidative stress tolerance than the pathogenic fungi.
DADS-induced oxidative stress drives soil community
reassembly and Penicillium enrichment
To verify that DADS-induced oxidative stress mediates rhizo-
sphere microbiome reassembly, we simulated oxidative stress
by exogenously applying H2O2 at varying concentrations and
analyzed subsequent changes in soil microbial communities
and disease suppression capacity (0, 85.9, 171.7, 343.4, and
686.9 μmol kg−1; designated as CK, H1, H2, H3, and H4)
(Figure 5A). The results showed that all H2O2-treated soils signif-
icantly reduced pepper blight lesion length, with H3 showing the
strongest suppression (Figure 5B; Supplemental Figure 28).

DADS treatments, H2O2 application significantly altered fungal
community structure compared with controls at both genus and
ASV
levels
(ANOSIM,

Supplemental
Table

Consistent with the garlic- and DADS-conditioned microbiome,
Penicillium was significantly enriched by H2O2 treatment, with
H1, H2, and H3 treatments driving significant enrichment relative
to CK (Figure 5C). ANOSIM confirmed high similarity between
H2O2- and DADS-driven communities (Supplemental Figure 29).
Metagenomic analysis revealed downregulation of thiamine
metabolism in Z3 and H3 treatments, while pathways such as
RNA transport were significantly upregulated (Figure 5D and
5F; Supplemental Figure 30). Biochemical assays validated
inhibited thiamine utilization in Z3, D3, and H3 treatments
(p < 0.05; Supplemental Figure 31). Additionally, D3 and Z3
treatments significantly increased apoptosis-related pathways
(e.g.,
apoptosis-fly)
(Figure
5D
and
5E).
These
results
demonstrate that garlic-derived DADS reshapes rhizosphere mi-
crobiomes via ROS stress, favoring Penicillium enrichment and
functional adaptation.
Co-application of DADS and Penicillium for disease
suppression and yield improvement
We conducted field trials to verify the effects of co-applying Peni-
cillium and DADS on disease suppression and yield improvement
across multiple crops. Three Penicillium isolates demonstrated
significant in vitro antagonistic activity against four economically
important Phytophthora pathogens: P. parasitica var. nicotianae
(tobacco), P. cactorum (strawberry), P. infestans (potato), and
P. sojae (soybean) (Supplemental Figure 32). Field trials showed
that
combining
Penicillium
isolates
with
DADS
improved
disease control and yield in pepper, tobacco, and soybean.
In pepper, co-application of 273.5 μM DADS and P. allii YNAU-
Q-6
significantly
reduced
Phytophthora
blight
incidence
(Figure 6A) and increased yield (Figure 6B). Similar benefits
were
observed
in
tobacco
and
soybean
(Supplemental

Pot
experiments
further
revealed
that
two
applications
of
Penicillium
with
DADS
maximized
pepper
biomass
(Figure

resistance
(Figure
6D).
Comparable
effects
were
also
observed
in
tobacco
and
soybean
(Supplemental
Figure
33).
Absolute
quantitative
analysis indicated that colonization of P. allii YNAU-Q-6 in the
pepper rhizosphere was enhanced by DADS (Figure 6E). These
findings indicate that DADS primes soil microbiomes to enrich
beneficial Penicillium strains, providing cross-crop protection
and yield gains (Figure 6F).
DISCUSSION
Crop rotation is widely adopted as a sustainable strategy for
the management of soil-borne diseases. Although it is well
documented that crop rotation enhances soil physical and
chemical properties and disrupts host–pathogen interactions
(Wang et al., 2021b; He et al., 2024), emerging evidence has
revealed a complex phenomenon: crops leave behind a soil
legacy that provides altruistic benefits for subsequent crops
but
imposes
detrimental
effects
on
themselves.
An
understanding of this altruistic yet self-detrimental behavior is
essential for efforts to refine crop-rotation systems. In the pre-
sent study, we demonstrate that garlic mediates such legacy ef-
fects through rhizosphere microbiome reprogramming. Garlic
root exudates, particularly DADS, generate ROS stress that re-
structures microbial communities. This stress selectively sup-
presses ROS-sensitive non-host pathogens while enriching
ROS-tolerant beneficial microbes and garlic-specific pathogens,
especially P. allii. Consequently, the garlic-conditioned rhizo-
sphere microbiome supports the health of subsequent crops
but creates a self-detrimental environment for garlic itself. Our
findings support a practical approach: co-application of DADS
and P. allii to harness garlic’s altruistic legacy for sustainable
disease suppression and yield improvement. This strategy
aligns with principles of eco-friendly agriculture by exploiting
natural plant–microbe interactions.
The garlic-conditioned rhizosphere microbiome exhibits altruistic
effects on non-Allium crops while remaining detrimental to garlic.
Recognition of this duality is critical when optimizing crop-rota-
tion practices to maximize both disease control and productivity.
Allium crops, including garlic, are established tools for soil-borne
disease management (Ding et al., 2018). Our meta-analysis and
in vivo experiments confirmed that garlic-conditioned soil micro-
biomes enhance the growth of solanaceous crops (e.g., tobacco,
pepper) by suppressing pathogens and inducing host resistance.
These beneficial outcomes were associated with enrichment of
diverse taxa, including Ramlibacter, Pseudomonas, Bacillus,
Enterobacter, Escherichia–Shigella, Pantoea, Enterococcus, Ly-
sinibacillus, Paenibacillus, Kluyvera, and Jeotgalibacillus (Hong
et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; He et al., 2024). P. allii
exemplifies the dual role of the microbiome. As plant growth-
promoting fungi, Penicillium spp. inhibit pathogens via produc-
tion
of
antimicrobial
metabolites
and
induction
of
resistance (Duan et al., 2014; Zhuang et al., 2021; Liu et al.,
2023). However, P. allii also exerts self-detrimental effects,
becoming pathogenic to garlic under stress conditions such as
high planting density or during post-harvest storage. This phe-
nomenon mirrors patterns observed in other systems, including
Burkholderia cepacia in onion and Streptomyces acidiscabies in
potato (Shang et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2023). Such findings are
consistent with host selection theory, which proposes that
plants
tend
to
recruit
microorganisms
offering
immediate
benefits but may inadvertently favor pathogens over time (Xiong
et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2025). To mitigate these risks while
preserving beneficial traits, biotechnological approaches could
be adapted for Penicillium strains. For instance, pathogenic
gene deletion (as demonstrated in engineered Burkholderia
ambifaria; Mullins et al., 2019) or the horizontal transfer of
detoxification genes (e.g., CYP genes; Guo et al., 2024) may
improve
microbial
safety
without
diminishing
biocontrol
efficacy. Harnessing altruistic microorganisms while minimizing
their self-detrimental traits is essential for sustainable agriculture.

Rhizo-microbiome strategy in crop-rotation systems
Future research should prioritize two directions: systematic
screening of rotation crops to maximize microbiome-mediated
benefits, and targeted engineering of microbial strains to sepa-
rate their beneficial and pathogenic characteristics.
Root-secreted antimicrobial metabolites shape rhizosphere mi-
crobiomes through ROS-mediated selection. Garlic roots release
DADS, a stable sulfide compound that imposes ROS stress and
restructures rhizosphere microbial communities. This study dem-
onstrates how DADS drives the formation of altruistic yet self-
detrimental microbial assemblages in garlic rhizosphere soil. At
physiological concentrations, DADS exhibits selective antimicro-
bial activity: suppressing non-host pathogens such as C. de-
structans and P. capsici while favoring tolerant microbes such
as Penicillium spp. Antimicrobial assays revealed the superior
tolerance of Penicillium to DADS-induced ROS stress compared
with sensitive pathogens. Transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) and
ROS staining demonstrated that Penicillium activates strong
antioxidant defenses, including upregulation of glutathione
S-transferase (GST) and cytochrome P450 (CYP628) genes. In
contrast, susceptible pathogens showed downregulation of key
genes (ECHS1, CDC6), impairing DNA replication and cell divi-
sion (Wu et al., 2024). Therefore, although DADS-mediated
ROS stress assists garlic in defending against non-host patho-
gens, it also enriches Penicillium, a microorganism that can func-
tion both as a beneficial microbe and as a pathogen. This dual
role underscores the trade-off inherent in garlic’s defense strat-
egy,

pathogens to circumvent chemical defenses (Cavagnaro et al.,
2005). Metagenomic analysis revealed that garlic cultivation
induces oxidative stress in the rhizosphere, enriching stress-
response pathways and apoptosis-related mechanisms. Experi-
mental validation demonstrated that exogenous DADS or H2O2
application can reproduce these community shifts, confirming
ROS as the main driver (Wu et al., 2024). These findings extend
beyond garlic. Many plant species utilize similar chemical
defenses, releasing secondary metabolites such as phenolic
acids,
allyl
isothiocyanate,
and
benzoxazines
that
trigger
pathogen ROS bursts (Voges et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021). Such
convergent stress responses may drive microbial communities
toward functional homogeneity (Ning et al., 2024), suggesting a
broader paradigm in plant–microbe interactions. By exploiting
root exudate–ROS–microbe dynamics, it may be possible to
design optimized rotation sequences that maximize beneficial
microbial legacy effects, develop targeted biocontrol strategies
using ROS-tolerant beneficial microbes, and implement chemical

Rhizo-microbiome strategy in crop-rotation systems
priming approaches to precondition soils for subsequent crops.
This work links chemical ecology with applied agriculture, offer-
ing solutions to the inherent trade-offs in plant defense strategies.
Effective soil-borne disease management requires stable coloni-
zation of beneficial microorganisms, which depends on persis-
tent ecological drivers. In agricultural practice, bioinoculants
often fail to deliver consistent field performance despite prom-
ising laboratory results, largely because of disparities between
controlled experimental conditions and the complexity of rhizo-
sphere environments (Sa´ nchez-Gil et al., 2023). Factors such as
soil heterogeneity, host genotype variation, and environmental
fluctuations frequently restrict the persistence and functionality
of introduced strains (Liu et al., 2024). The present study
demonstrates that co-application of DADS as a prebiotic and
P. allii as a probiotic addresses these limitations through syner-
gistic mechanisms. In contrast to monofunctional bioinoculants,
this dual strategy harnesses ecological selection pressures to
enhance microbial sustainability. DADS, a sulfur-containing sec-
ondary metabolite released from garlic roots, establishes oxida-
tive stress niches that selectively enrich stress-adapted P. allii
while suppressing pathogens. This mutualistic relationship re-
flects natural rhizosphere selection processes, enabling P. allii
to become a dominant community member. The prebiotic–
probiotic synergy provides several distinct advantages. First,
DADS sustains P. allii colonization by continually modifying the
soil microenvironment, analogous to the manner in which
inositol supports Pseudomonas fluorescens persistence through
siderophore induction (Sa´ nchez-Gil et al., 2023). Second,
DADS exhibits multifunctional activity—directly suppressing
pathogens at bioactive concentrations (Cheng et al., 2016)
while
promoting
plant
growth.
Third,
emerging
evidence
suggests that DADS indirectly recruits beneficial microbes by
modulating root exudate profiles (Zhou et al., 2024), although
such mechanisms warrant further investigation.
In summary, this study identified Penicillium as the principal mi-
crobial
component
underlying
garlic’s
altruistic
effects,
revealing remarkable tolerance to garlic-derived DADS-induced
oxidative stress. We elucidated the chemical–ecological mech-
anisms shaping these altruistic interactions in crop-rotation sys-
tems,
leading
to
practical
insights
for
improved
disease
management. The co-application of DADS and Penicillium pro-
vides an environmentally friendly strategy for sustainable control
of soil-borne pathogens, combining plant-derived metabolites
with
stress-adapted
beneficial
microbes
to
enhance
field
performance.
METHODS
Meta-analysis of garlic rotation effects on subsequent crop
yield and verification in pot experiments
This meta-analysis integrated data from 21 independent studies (70
observational data points) evaluating the effects of garlic rotation on sub-
sequent crop yields (Supplemental Table 7). The treatment group
comprised fields cultivated with garlic; control groups included fallow
plots, winter wheat fields aligned with garlic planting schedules, and
continuous cropping systems. Yield data—including means, standard
deviations, and replication numbers—were extracted in accordance
with established protocols (Zhang et al., 2022). Random-effects models
were applied using MetaWin 3.0.14 to calculate global effect sizes with
95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical significance was inferred from
the absence of overlap between 95% CIs and zero. Complete methodo-
logical details are provided in the Supplemental Methods.
Soil-conditioning effects were assessed using a standardized bioassay.
Garlic-conditioned
soil
collected
via
the
root
bag
method
(see
Supplemental Methods) or unplanted control soil was mixed with
sterilized substrate (moist-heat sterilization at 121◦C for 30 min) at a 1:9
weight ratio (Ma et al., 2020). Three solanaceous species were tested:
pepper (Capsicum annuum), tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana), and
potato (Solanum tuberosum). Total plant dry biomass at 60 days after
planting was considered the primary endpoint. Each treatment included
a minimum of four replicates to ensure statistical robustness.
Assessment of Phytophthora disease suppression by garlic-
conditioned soil
The capacity of garlic-conditioned soil to suppress Phytophthora disease
was evaluated through a standardized bioassay (Figure 1C). Garlic-
conditioned or unplanted control soil was mixed with sterilized soil
(moist-heat sterilization at 121◦C for 30 min) at a 1:9 (w/w) ratio. Healthy
pepper seedlings were transplanted into pots (34.5 × 26.5 × 12.5 cm)
containing the soil mixtures, with nine plants per pot. After 70 days of
growth, the central seedling was inoculated with P. capsici; surrounding
seedlings served as indicators of disease spread. Disease incidence
was recorded 60 days after inoculation, and blank PDA plates were
used as negative controls. Each treatment consisted of four biological
replicates (Yang et al., 2014).
The capacity of garlic-conditioned soil microorganisms to induce resis-
tance
was
examined
through
hydroponic
and
pot
experiments
(Figure 1C). For hydroponic testing, pepper seedlings were maintained
in 220-ml tissue culture bottles containing 60 ml of sterilized Hoagland
solution. Soil extracts were prepared by mixing 100 g of garlic-
conditioned or control soil with 900 ml of sterile ddH2O (1:9 w/v), followed
by 30 min of rotation (140 rpm, 25◦C) and filtration. Two types of filtrates
were obtained: 0.22-μm membrane-filtered (microbe-free) and unfiltered.
Seedlings received 20 ml of the respective extracts for 5 days before inoc-
ulation with P. capsici. Stem lesion lengths were measured 5 days post-
inoculation, with four replicates per treatment (one plant per bottle) (Gu
et
al.,
2020).
Pot
experiments
used
containers
(10.5
cm
upper
diameter × 9.5 cm height) filled with soil mixtures (1:9 treated:sterile
soil, w/w). Seventy-day-old pepper seedlings were transplanted and pre-
treated for 5 days, then inoculated with P. capsici. Lesion development
was analyzed in relation to soil microbial community composition
(Figure 2A). Each pot contained six seedlings, with four replicate pots
per treatment.
The antifungal activity of soil microorganisms was quantified through
liquid culture inhibition assays (Figure 1C; Figure 2A). Soil suspensions
(3 g soil in 27 ml sterile water) were prepared as described above.
Inhibition of P. capsici was assessed by adding 5 ml of soil suspension
to 45 ml of carrot liquid medium containing five pre-cultured mycelial
plugs (5 mm diameter). Cultures were incubated at 140 rpm for 72 h,
then filtered and dried at 60◦C for biomass quantification. Controls con-
sisted of sterile water in place of soil suspension, with three replicates
per treatment (Luo et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023).
Qualitative and quantitative detection of garlic rhizosphere
sulfides
Volatile sulfur compounds in garlic rhizosphere soil were qualitatively as-
sessed using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with GC–
MS (HS–SPME/GC–MS). Five grams of garlic-conditioned soil (Z3,
three garlic plants per pot) or control soil (CK) were placed in sealed
collection bottles. A 50/30 μm DVB/CAR/PDMS SPME fiber (57328-U, Su-
pelco) was exposed to the headspace at 35◦C for 1 h prior to thermal
desorption in the GC–MS inlet. Metabolite profiling was performed using
MicrobiomeAnalyst
(https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca/).

GC–MS parameters are provided in the Supplemental Methods (Qian
et al., 2022).
DADS and related sulfur metabolites were quantified in garlic root exu-
dates through liquid–liquid extraction followed by GC–MS. Garlic seed-
lings were grown in root bags at densities of 1–5 plants per pot for
30 days, then transferred to hydroponic systems containing 125 ml of ster-
ile ddH2O for 48 h of exudate collection (Luo et al., 2022). The experiment
included four biological replicates, each consisting of pooled exudates
from six pots (24 pots per treatment). For sample preparation, 10-ml
aliquots of exudate were mixed with 20 ml of ethyl acetate (1:2 v/v),
concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40◦C, and reconstituted in 6 ml of
n-hexane.
After
filtration
through
0.22-μm
polytetrafluoroethylene
membranes, samples were stored in amber vials at 4◦C for less than 24
h before analysis. A five-point calibration curve (0, 34.2, 68.4, 102.6,
and 136.7 μM) was generated via serial dilution of authentic sulfur stan-
dards in n-hexane (Ji et al., 2025). GC–MS analysis utilized parameters
identical to the HS–SPME method, enabling direct comparison between
volatile and soluble sulfur pools. This dual approach allowed comprehen-
sive characterization of both volatile and water-soluble sulfur compounds
in the garlic rhizosphere.
High-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis of
microbial communities
High-throughput sequencing. Soil DNA was extracted using the E.Z.N.
A. Soil DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA). Specific sequences
were amplified using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primer pairs ITS1F
(5′-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3′) and ITS2R (5′-GCTGCGTTCTT
CATCGATGC-3′) for fungal communities, and 16S rRNA primer pairs
338F (5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVG
GGTWTCTAAT-3′) for bacterial communities. PCR amplification was per-
formed under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95◦C for 3
min, followed by 27 cycles of denaturation (95◦C, 30 s), annealing (55◦C,
30 s), and elongation (72◦C, 30 s), with a final extension at 72◦C
for 10 min. PCR products were separated via electrophoresis on 1%
agarose gel, then pooled in equimolar concentrations based on
Qubit quantification. Paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illu-
mina MiSeq platform at Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology (Shanghai,
China) following manufacturer protocols. Each dataset was independently
re-processed using a standardized bioinformatics pipeline with QIIME2
and DADA2. Taxonomic classification of bacterial sequences was per-
formed with the SILVA 16S rRNA gene database using the Naive Bayes
classifier. Fungal taxonomic assignments were conducted with the
UNITE database (version 8.3). ASVs were taxonomically annotated with
a scikit-learn multinomial Naive Bayes classifier implemented in QIIME2
to represent sequence and abundance information (Simonin et al., 2022).
Metagenomic analysis. Total genomic DNA was extracted using the Mag-
Bind Soil DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. DNA concentration and purity were determined with a TBS-380 fluo-
rometer
and
a
NanoDrop2000
spectrophotometer,
respectively.
DNA quality was verified by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. Data
were analyzed on the Majorbio Cloud Platform (http://www.majorbio.
com). Briefly, paired-end Illumina reads were trimmed of adapters, and
low-quality reads (length < 50 bp, quality score < 20) were removed using
fastp (v0.20.0, https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp). Contigs ≥300 bp in
length were retained for assembly and used for subsequent gene prediction
and annotation. KEGG annotation was performed using DIAMOND (v0.8.35)
against the KEGG database (Yin et al., 2025). Raw sequencing data have
been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
RNA-seq analysis of DADS-treated microorganisms and ROS
staining verification
RNA-seq analysis was conducted as follows: Ten fungal blocks of
C. destructans or P. allii were inoculated into 100 ml of potato glucose liquid
culture medium and pre-incubated on a rotary shaker at 140 rpm and 28◦C
for 120 h. The medium was supplemented with DADS methanol solution at
final concentrations of 13.7 or 273.5 μM for P. allii, 273.5 μM for
C. destructans, and 683.7 μM for P. capsici. Methanol (1%, v/v) served as
the control. Following 24 h of continuous shaking at 28◦C, the supernatant
was discarded, and mycelia were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at −80◦C for subsequent RNA extraction. Total RNA was iso-
lated using TRIzol Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
A cDNA library was prepared from enriched cDNA and sequenced on an Il-
lumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using paired-end 150-bp reads. Differen-
tially expressed genes (DEGs) between control and DADS-treated samples
were identified by quantifying transcript levels via the transcripts per million
(TPM) method. Statistical analysis was performed using DESeq2, with sig-
nificance thresholds set at |log2 fold change (FC)| > 2 and an adjusted p-
value <0.05. To validate DEGs, RT–qPCR was conducted using primers
listed in Supplemental Table 8. Gene expression was normalized to 18S
rRNA (for P. allii and C. destructans) or Actin-1 (for P. capsici) as reference
genes, and relative quantification was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method.
DEGs were functionally annotated through the KEGG pathway database,
and pathway enrichment analysis was performed to elucidate metabolic
perturbations (Wu et al., 2024).
ROS generation was visualized using DCFH-DA, a ROS-specific fluores-
cent dye (Solarbio, China). Conidial or zoospore suspensions were pre-
inoculated in potato dextrose liquid medium for 120 h in shaking culture
(140 rpm) at 28◦C. Subsequently, DADS at concentrations of 0, 13.7,
273.5, and 683.7 μM was separately added to the medium for 24 h at
28◦C. After treatment, developed mycelia were incubated with DCFH-
DA for 25 min at 28◦C in the dark, followed by three washes with sterile wa-
ter prior to microscopic observation. ROS staining was observed using
fluorescence microscopy (Leica DM2000, Germany) (Pan et al., 2023;
Wu
et
al.,
2024).
In
addition,
ROS
fluorescence
intensity
was
quantitatively detected with a Varioskan LUX multimode microplate
reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Excitation and emission wavelengths
were set to 488 nm and 525 nm, respectively (Wu et al., 2024).
Exogenous DADS and H2O2 application to soil to simulate
garlic-conditioned soil
The DADS concentration range was determined through root exudation
analysis, and two experimental series were conducted using the rhizo-
sphere bag method (Supplemental Figure 34). Soil treatments included
four DADS concentration gradients (D1, D2, D3, and D4 representing
soil DADS concentrations of 13.7, 27.3, 54.7, and 109.4 μmol kg−1,
respectively) and four H2O2 concentration gradients (H1, H2, H3, and
H4 representing soil H2O2 concentrations of 85.9, 171.7, 343.4, and
686.9 μmol kg−1, respectively), along with an untreated control group.
DADS was applied to evaluate the effects of sulfur-containing compounds
on soil microbiota, while H2O2 was used to assess the impacts of ROS on
soil microbial communities. DADS emulsifiable concentrate (0.005%
Tween-20) and H2O2 aqueous solution were applied twice to the rhizo-
sphere bags on day 0 and day 15. Soil samples were collected after
30 days of incubation under controlled conditions (25◦C ± 1◦C, 60% field
capacity) for subsequent analysis (Figures 3D and 5A).
Field experiments
Field yield experiments were conducted in Qilin District, Yunnan Province,
China
(103.86◦E,
25.41◦N).
Each
plot
measured
6

(length × width), and pepper or soybean seedlings were randomly
selected from each plot for yield assessment. Each treatment consisted
of five replicate plots. Greenhouse experiments were conducted in Xun-
dian County, Yunnan Province, China (103.29◦E, 25.51◦N) to evaluate dis-
ease control effectiveness. Each plot measured 1.5 m × 1.3 m
(length × width), and disease incidence of P. capsici and Phytophthora
parasitica var. nicotianae was assessed. Each plot contained nine pepper
or tobacco seedlings, with five replicate plots per treatment. Both exper-
iments included six treatments: control (CK); YNAU-Q-6 alone; 13.7 μM
DADS; 13.7 μM DADS combined with YNAU-Q-6; 273.5 μM DADS; and

273.5 μM DADS combined with YNAU-Q-6. The concentration of P. allii
YNAU-Q-6 spores was set to 106 colony-forming units (CFU) ml−1.
The colonization effects of Penicillium in the pepper rhizosphere were
evaluated under six treatment conditions: control (CK); P. allii YNAU-Q-
6 alone; single application of 273.5 μM DADS; double application of
273.5 μM DADS; single application of 273.5 μM DADS combined with
YNAU-Q-6; and double application of 273.5 μM DADS combined with
YNAU-Q-6. Quantification of Penicillium colonization was performed us-
ing an ITS-based absolute quantification approach. This involved con-
structing a standard curve through correlation analysis between known
concentrations of spike-in DNA (expressed as copies per microliter) and
corresponding

obtained
via

tween treatments was analyzed using one-way ANOVA (for three or
more groups) or a t-test (for two groups) in SPSS Statistics 19 (IBM,
USA). A significance threshold of p < 0.05 was applied for all analyses.
