In eastern India, the rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS) faces challenges
like poverty, fragmented landholdings, and resource overexploitation, with
smallholder farmers prioritizing short-term gains through excessive water and
nitrogen use. To address these issues, our study combined ﬁeld experiments
and the DNDC crop simulation model to evaluate the resilience, viability, and
environmental sustainability of RWCS under conservation agriculture (CA) with
varying irrigation methods and nitrogen rates at the International Rice Research
Institute-South Asia Regional Center (ISARC), Varanasi, India. The treatments
included: (1) Puddled transplanted rice followed by zero-tilled wheat with ﬂood
irrigation (PTR-ZTW-F), (2) Direct-seeded rice followed by ZTW with ﬂood
irrigation (DSR-ZTW-F), (3) DSR followed by ZTW with surface drip fertigation
(DSR-ZTW-SD), and (4) DSR followed by ZTW with subsurface drip fertigation
(DSR-ZTW-SSD), evaluated under 75% and 100% recommended nitrogen dose
and nitrogen control plots. The DNDC model accurately predicted soil mineral N
(NO−

DSR-ZTW systems with drip fertigation signiﬁcantly enhanced sustainability and
productivity compared to PTR-ZTW system, where CH4 emissions were reduced
by 70%–80% and global warming potential reduced by 56%, despite higher
N2O emissions. Additionally, DSR-ZTW-SSD achieved the highest system yield
(12.8 t ha−1), minimized water losses, and improved nitrogen use eﬃciency.
Also, TOPSIS analysis ranked DSR-ZTW-SSDF as the most sustainable system,
achieving the highest yield and resource use eﬃciency, while signiﬁcantly

CA, drip fertigation, and DSR to enhance productivity, conserve resources, and

1 Introduction
The rice (Oryza sativa L.)–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
cropping system (RWCS) is crucial for global food security,
providing essential staples for a signiﬁcant portion of the world’s
population (Banjara et al., 2021; Dhanda et al., 2022). This system is
widely practiced across Asia, spanning 13.5 Mha, with 57% located
in South Asia, predominantly in the Indo-Gangetic Plains. In India,
RWCS spans ∼10 Mha, producing 130 Mt of rice and 106 Mt
of wheat, contributing around 75% of the nation’s cereal output
and playing a vital role in food security and economic stability
(Ladha et al., 2009; ICAR Annual Report, 2023). Traditionally, rice
in RWCS is cultivated through puddled transplanted rice (PTR),
involving intense puddling, followed by seedling transplanting,
while wheat is grown under conventional tillage (CTW) following
rice residue burning and multiple tillage operations (Peramaiyan
et al., 2023). The continuous adoption of PTR has deleterious
eﬀects on the subsequent CTW crop due to subsoil compaction and
structural degradation of soil, impairing root architecture and water
movement (Chauhan et al., 2012). Additionally, these traditional
practices lead to soil health deterioration, groundwater depletion,
residue burning hazards, resource ineﬃciency, yield stagnation,
reduced proﬁtability, multi-nutrient deﬁciency, and increased
energy use (Humphreys and Gaydon, 2015). The resource-, energy-
, and labor-intensive nature of RWCS, coupled with its signiﬁcant
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, poses substantial challenges to
its sustainability (Gupta et al., 2016).
India is considered as the world’s third-largest emitter of
GHGs, with agriculture contributing ∼16% of total emissions.
Among them, 74% of emissions are attributable to methane
(CH4), primarily from livestock (38.9%) and rice cultivation
(36.9%), and the remaining 26% from N2O emissions (Vetter
et al., 2017). Climate change, population growth, and depleting
natural resources further exacerbate these challenges, making an
imperative demand for adoption of sustainable interventions in
the RWCS to ensure environmental stewardship and economic
resilience. Research must focus on cost-eﬀective, resource-eﬃcient,
and eco-friendly practices to sustain this vital agricultural
system. Approaches such as conservation agriculture (CA),
direct-seeded rice (DSR), and micro-irrigation are emerging
as promising solutions. These practices not only improve
productivity, proﬁtability, and sustainability but also reduce
environmental impacts, thereby supporting food security and
livelihoods across South Asia (Parihar et al., 2017; Kumar et al.,
2023; Sharma et al., 2023).
CA has emerged as a key strategy for sustainable farming,
enhancing productivity and long-term sustainability through
residue retention, minimal tillage, and crop diversiﬁcation (Parihar
et al., 2018; Patra S. et al., 2023). Globally, CA is practiced on
∼205 Mha (12.5% of total cropland), primarily in developed
countries. Adoption in Asia and Africa remains limited, with
only 13.9 Mha and 1.5 Mha, respectively, due to small-scale and
subsistence farming (Jat et al., 2020). In India, CA is more prevalent
in the northwest IGPs due to favorable conditions and robust
infrastructure, while the eastern IGP lags behind, necessitating
region-speciﬁc research and its strategic promotion (Kumar et al.,
2024a). DSR oﬀers an alternative to PTR, conserving resources and
labor, primarily by eliminating puddling and transplanting (Kumar
and Ladha, 2011; Panneerselvam et al., 2020; Reddy et al., 2025).
Further, with increasing water scarcity, transitioning from ﬂood
irrigation to micro-irrigation systems is critical for enhancing water
productivity in RWCS (Rana et al., 2023). Drip irrigation has gained
momentum as a cost-eﬀective method for crops like maize, rice, and
wheat (Sidhu et al., 2019). Subsurface drip fertigation (SSD) further
optimizes resource use by eliminating lateral repositioning required
in surface drip fertigation (SD), extending system longevity, and
improving nitrogen eﬃciency by subsurface placement (Hagin
et al., 2003; Patra K. et al., 2023). Integrating these resource-
saving technologies (CA, DSR, and SSD) in the eastern IGP could
enhance RWCS productivity and sustainability while minimizing
environmental impact.
Crop models are essential tools for evaluating the productivity
and sustainability of agricultural systems, simulating complex
interactions between crops, the environment, and management
practices (Kumar et al., 2024b). These models integrate knowledge
from agronomy, soil science, meteorology, and plant physiology to
assess the impacts of factors like climate change, soil properties,
irrigation, and nutrient management on crop performance (Kumar
et al., 2024c). By enabling researchers to optimize agricultural
practices, crop models enhance eﬃciency and sustainability,
oﬀering critical insights for decision-making and advancing
hypothesis testing without extensive ﬁeld trials. They play a
pivotal role in steering sustainable agriculture to meet global
food demands while preserving ecological integrity (Chen et al.,
2018; Zhao et al., 2020). Unlike traditional models, biogeochemical
and process-based models such as DayCent (Begum et al., 2019),
DeNitriﬁcation-DeComposition (DNDC) (Zhao et al., 2020), and
water and nitrogen management model (Chen et al., 2018) apply
scientiﬁc principles to simulate agricultural systems. These models
evaluate the eﬀects of water management, nitrogen application,
and organic amendments on GHG emissions and crop yield under
various soil and climate conditions (Minamikawa et al., 2014;
Chun et al., 2016). The DNDC model, for instance, integrates C
and N cycling processes within the soil-plant-atmospheric system,
enabling researchers to explore scenarios related to sustainable
agriculture, climate change adaptation, and resource management.

Reddy et al.

By leveraging these models, users can make data-driven decisions
to improve crop productivity, enhance resource eﬃciency, and
mitigate environmental impacts.
The DNDC model has demonstrated strong performance
under diverse agroclimatic conditions in simulating crop growth,
soil water and N dynamics, and GHG emissions (Jiang R. et al.,
2019; Zhao et al., 2020; Abdalla et al., 2022). However, its
application in system-based studies, coupled with adoption of
CA and drip fertigation remains limited globally. To address this
gap, a detailed investigation is necessary to evaluate the DNDC
model’s performance under these conditions. Hence, the study
aims to address the following objectives: (1) calibrate and evaluate
the DNDC model (v9.5) using measured soil parameters (NO−
3 ,
NH+
4 , WFPS, temperature, redox potential), crop yield, and N
uptake; (2) estimate GHG emissions (CH4 and N2O) and assess
N and water balance across diﬀerent treatments; (3) evaluate the
overall performance of CA, DSR, and micro-irrigation systems in
the RWCS.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Description of experimental site and
details
The ﬁeld experiment was initiated in 2019, and since its
inception, a CA-based rice-wheat rotation has been implemented
with the speciﬁed irrigation methods (Table 1) at the ISARC
experimental farm, Varanasi, India (25.310◦N, 82.970◦E; elevation:
80.71 m above mean sea level). The present study was conducted
during the kharif (rainy) and rabi (winter) seasons of 2022–23
and 2023–24. The experimental station is located in the eastern
IGPs with a humid subtropical climate, with an average annual
temperature of 26◦C, annual rainfall of 1,100 mm, and an average
of 9.7 h of sunshine per day. Weather conditions during the study
period are illustrated in Figure 1, and soil properties at the time of
initial setup of the model are detailed in Supplementary Table 1.
The ﬁeld experiment followed a randomized complete block
design with three replications. Treatment and management
speciﬁcations are described in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2.
Each experimental plot measured 35 m2 (7.0 m × 5.0 m). Drip
irrigation systems (SD and SSD) were installed at 60 cm spacing,
with SSD positioned 10 cm below the soil surface.
2.2 Field measurements
Soil samples for measuring mineral N (NH+
4 N and NO−
3
N) were collected and analyzed at 1-,3-, 5-, and 9-days post-
fertilization, and then weekly basis using the micro Kjeldahl
distillation method (Prasad et al., 2006). Soil water-ﬁlled pore space
(WFPS) was measured using the PR2 soil moisture proﬁle probe
(Delta-T Devices, UK). These probes were calibrated at speciﬁc
ﬁeld sites, ensuring readings were within 1%−2% of soil moisture
content determined volumetrically. The volume (%) readings were
converted to WFPS (%) for evaluation with the DNDC model.
Soil Eh and temperature were measured using the Hanna ORP
tester and a soil thermometer, respectively. All these soil properties,

has been obtained from a 10 m2 area omitting the border rows and
reported at 14% moisture content. N uptake has been calculated by
analyzing the N concentration in grain and straw samples using the
Kjeldahl digestion method (Prasad et al., 2006).
2.3 DNDC model
In this study, the DNDC model version 9.5 (http://www.dndc.
sr.unh.edu/) was employed to simulate biogeochemical ﬂuxes of
C and N in agricultural ecosystems. Originally developed by Li
et al. (1992a, 2012), the DNDC model captures the complex
interactions between soil and crop dynamics, including parameters
such as SOC, temperature, moisture, pH, redox potential, and
substrate concentration gradients. By integrating environmental
data, crop growth parameters, and management practices, the
model estimates daily ﬂuxes of C and N and emissions of trace gases
(CO2, N2O, CH4, NH3) (Li et al., 1992b; Li, 2000; Giltrap et al.,
2010). These simulations are crucial for assessing the impacts of
agricultural practices on GHG emissions and soil health, oﬀering
insights for sustainable farming. The DNDC model comprises
two main components: the physio-chemical and biochemical sub-
models. The physio-chemical sub-model simulates soil, climate,
crop growth, and decomposition processes in response to ecological
drivers such as climate, soil properties, and anthropogenic
activities, predicting key soil environmental parameters (Li, 2000).
The biochemical sub-model focuses on nitriﬁcation, denitriﬁcation,
and fermentation processes, estimating trace gas emissions based
on physio-chemical inputs (Li et al., 1992b; Zhang F. et al., 2018;
Zhang Y. et al., 2018). The model incorporates the “anaerobic
balloon” concept to track GHG emissions at the ﬁeld level. Using
the Nernst and Michaelis–Menten equations, it simulates redox
reactions producing GHGs (Li et al., 1992a). CH4 production

is modeled by calculating substrate concentrations and tracking
reductive reactions involving electron donors [H2 and dissolved
organic carbon (DOC)] and acceptors (O2, NO−
3 , Mn4+, Fe3+,
SO2−
4 , CO2), with production occurring when soil Eh falls below
−150 mV. CH4 consumption is simulated as an oxidation reaction
under aerobic conditions. N2O emissions are predicted through
nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation processes, with reaction rates
determined by the Michaelis–Menten equation (Li et al., 2004).
2.3.1 Model inputs
The DNDC model requires comprehensive input data to
accurately simulate biogeochemical processes. These include: (1)
daily meteorological data such as temperature, precipitation, wind
speed, solar radiation, and relative humidity; (2) initial soil
conditions like SOC, NO−
3
and NH+

content, ﬁeld capacity,
wilting point, bulk density, pH, and texture; and (3) agricultural
management practices, including planting and harvest dates,
crop parameters, tillage methods, and fertilizer application rates.
For this study, meteorological data were obtained from the
automatic weather station at the ISARC experimental farm
in Varanasi, with daily weather trends shown in Figure 1.
Experimental data from 2022–23 and 2023–24 was used for model
calibration and evaluation, respectively, as described in Section
2.3.2. Management practices, including tillage, planting dates,
and fertilization schedules, are detailed in Supplementary Table 2.
Default crop parameters were ﬁne-tuned to minimize RMSE
for simulated variables and align with observed crop maturity,
improving model accuracy.
2.3.2 Calibration and evaluation of the model
The DNDC model was executed continuously over a 2-year
rice-wheat rotation to capture the persistent eﬀects of CA. Dataset
from 2022–23 was used for calibration, while 2023–24 dataset was
reserved for evaluation. Calibration was performed separately for
DSR and PTR, using N control and 100% N treatments representing
stressed and unstressed conditions, respectively. Simulated outputs
for NO−
3 , NH+
4 , soil temperature, WFPS, Eh, crop yield, and N
uptake were calibrated against ﬁeld data collected from 2022–23
cropping season, following methods described by Thomas and
Hao (2017). The calibration process involved optimizing crop
growth parameters such as maximum biomass, biomass fraction,
C/N ratio, thermal degree days, water demand, and optimal
temperature, as outlined by Abdalla et al. (2020) and Zhang
et al. (2024). Finalized calibration parameters are detailed in
Supplementary Table 3. Validation was performed using the 2023–
24 dataset, assessing the model’s performance across all variables.
2.3.3 Model sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis of the DNDC model was performed to
evaluate the inﬂuence of various input parameters on crop yield
and cumulative CH4 and N2O emissions. The 2022–23 dataset with
100% N treatments was used as the baseline scenario after model
calibration and validation. Each parameter was independently
adjusted while keeping others constant, and simulations were
conducted to measure the eﬀects of changes in soil pH (+2,
−2), SOC (+200%, −200%), bulk density (+50%, −50%), ﬁeld
capacity (+50%, −50%), porosity (+50%, −50%), residue quantity
(100%, 0%), microbial activity (0.5, 1), ﬂooding duration (+20
days, −20 days), and N and P application rates (kg ha−1) (+100%,
−100%). Following the independent adjustment of each parameter,
a sensitivity index (SI) was calculated using the equation proposed
by Zhao et al. (2020):
Sensitivity Index (SI) = (Rmax −Rmin)/Ravg
(Pmax −Pmin)/Pavg
Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems
04
frontiersin.org
Reddy et al.
10.3389/fsufs.2025.1499425
Where, Pmax and Pmin are the maximum and minimum input
parameters, respectively; Pavg is the average of Pmin and Pmax;
Rmax and Rmin are the corresponding output values to Pmax and
Pmin; and Ravg is the average of Rmax and Rmin. When the value
of SI is 1, the simulated values will change by the same proportion
as the mean, while the input value changes by a certain proportion
relative to the mean. A negative value of SI indicates a negative
correlation between the simulated values and input parameters, and
positive values of SI indicate greater eﬀects of the input parameters
on the simulation value. The SI values can compare the model’s
sensitivity under diﬀerent parameters.
2.3.4 Simulating GHG emission, nitrogen and
water balance
After successful calibration and validation (Section 2.3.2), daily
GHG emissions were simulated for each treatment, and seasonal
emissions were calculated by summing daily ﬂuxes from sowing
to harvest. CH4 and N2O emissions, initially reported in kg C
ha−1 and kg N ha−1, were converted to kg CH4 ha−1 and kg N2O
ha−1 using factors of 1.33 and 1.57, respectively. These emissions
were then standardized to CO2-equivalent terms using GWP values
over 100 years, with CH4 and N2O multiplied by factors of 27
and 273, respectively (Forster et al., 2021; IPCC, 2021). Further,
the model was employed to simulate components of water and
nitrogen balances, estimating the pathways of these components
within each cropping system over 2 years. Water and nitrogen
mean balance errors (WMBE and NMBE) were calculated by
subtracting the sum of all components and balance from the total
input and dividing by the total input, providing a measure of
model accuracy.
2.4 Statistical evaluation of the model
The eﬃcacy of the model was assessed through the application
of six distinct statistical metrics, namely: the coeﬃcient of
determination (R2), the root means square error (RMSE), the
relative root means square error (RRMSE), the Nash-Sutcliﬀe
eﬃciency (NSE), Willmott’s index of agreement (d-stat), and the
mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics were utilized to appraise
the model’s performance by comparing the simulated data against
the observed measurements (Nash and Sutcliﬀe, 1970; Willmott,
1982; Jamieson et al., 1991; Moriasi et al., 2007).

2.5 TOPSIS analysis
We
employed
multicriteria
decision
analysis
using
the
Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution
(TOPSIS)
to
evaluate
and
rank
the
treatments
based
on
seven criteria: system yield, system proﬁtability (data given in
Supplementary Table 4), GWP, nitrogen uptake, nitrogen loss,
water use, and non-productive water loss. The criteria were
classiﬁed as beneﬁts (system yield, system proﬁtability, nitrogen
uptake) or costs (GWP, nitrogen loss, water use, water loss),
with weights assigned to reﬂect their importance: system yield
(0.2), system proﬁtability (0.2), GWP (0.2), nitrogen uptake (0.1),
nitrogen loss (0.1), water use (0.1), and non-productive water
loss (0.1). The analysis involved normalizing the data using
vector normalization to ensure comparability, followed by weighted
normalization to incorporate the assigned weights. Ideal and
negative-ideal solutions were determined to represent the best and
worst performances for each criterion. Euclidean distances to these
solutions were used to calculate the closeness coeﬃcient, which
quantiﬁed the proximity of each treatment to the ideal solution.
Higher closeness coeﬃcients indicated better overall performance,
and treatments were ranked accordingly (Hwang and Yoon, 1981;
Chakraborty, 2022). All analyses and visualizations were conducted
using “topsis” package in R statistical software (R Core Team, 2022).

3 Results
3.1 Calibration and evaluation of the DNDC
model
The DNDC model was calibrated by ﬁne-tuning crop
parameters listed in Supplementary Table 3, enhancing its ability to
simulate crop performance and soil dynamic properties. The well
calibrated and validated model showed high accuracy in replicating
observed crop growth and soil parameters for the RWCS.
3.1.1 Soil properties
The DNDC model demonstrated robust performance in
simulating soil properties. Performance statistics for calibration
and evaluation phases are provided in Supplementary Table 5,
highlighting the model’s accuracy and reliability. The metrics
underscore the model’s ability to consistently replicate observed soil
property dynamics.
3.1.1.1 Soil mineral N (NO−
3 N and NH+
4 N)
Observed
and
simulated
data
indicated
that
NH+
4 –N
dominated mineral N in rice growing season, while NO−
3 –N was
more prevalent in wheat growing season (Figure 2). During the
rice phase, NO−
3 –N concentrations were lower in PTR plots but
signiﬁcantly higher in DSR across treatments. In 100% N-applied
plots, the highest and lowest mineral N concentrations were
observed in SSD and ﬂooded DSR plots, respectively. Among
ﬂooded treatments, mineral N concentrations were higher in PTR
than DSR during rice growth, while concentrations were higher in
wheat following DSR compared to wheat following PTR, likely due
to the puddling eﬀect. The model eﬀectively simulated soil mineral
N dynamics (NO−

100% RDN) and various establishment and irrigation methods,
achieving mean R2 values of 0.85 for NO−
3 –N and 0.79 for NH+
4 –N.
However, moderate NSE values (0.76 for NO−
3 –N and 0.73 for
NH+
4 –N) and high RMSE (0.93 kg N ha−1 and 2.11 kg N ha−1)
and RRMSE (52.9% and 62.5%) suggest room for improvement in
model accuracy.
3.1.1.2 Water-ﬁlled pore space (WFPS)
The DNDC model eﬀectively simulated daily WFPS trends,
which were largely inﬂuenced by precipitation and irrigation
(Figure 3). Simulated WFPS are closely aligned with seasonal
measurements across treatments, except during the wheat-growing
period in both the calibration (2022–23) and evaluation (2023–
24) phases. Temporal variations in ﬂooded plots under PTR
and DSR systems were accurately predicted, while WFPS was
signiﬁcantly overestimated in SD and SSD treatments of DSR-based
systems. The correlation between observed and simulated values
conﬁrmed the model’s strong performance in simulating WFPS% at
0 cm−20 cm depth, with metrics including an R2 of 0.85, RMSE of
0.12, RRMSE of 20.42%, and NSE of 0.84. During the rice growing
season, mean WFPS% was higher in ﬂooded plots (PTR and DSR)
compared to SD and SSD plots. However, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
was observed during the wheat-growing season.
3.1.1.3 Soil temperature
The DNDC model eﬀectively simulated daily soil temperature
variations at 0 cm−5 cm depth throughout the calibration and
evaluation phases of the RWCS, with minor overestimations
during
calibration
and
underestimations
during
evaluation
(Figure 4).
Observed
ﬂuctuations
in
soil
temperature
were
primarily inﬂuenced by air temperature at the experimental site,
and no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were noted across treatments. The
model captured temperature variations more accurately during the
wet season (kharif rice) than the dry season (rabi wheat) (Figure 4).
Performance metrics demonstrated high accuracy, with an R2 of
0.91, RMSE of 1.28◦C, RRMSE of 4.58%, and NSE of 0.93.
3.1.1.4 Redox potential
Eh measurements were taken exclusively during the rice season.
The DNDC model tended to overestimate Eh, particularly after
the drainage of ﬂood water (Figure 5). Eh responded predictably to
irrigation events, decreasing after re-ﬂooding and increasing post-
drainage. In PTR treatments, with frequent ﬂooding, Eh showed
signiﬁcant variability, whereas in DSR-ﬂooded treatments, where
ﬂooding was controlled, Eh remained mostly positive. In SD and
SSD treatments, Eh dropped below 0 mV only during rainfall-
induced ﬂooding and remained above 100 mV otherwise. The
model demonstrated a strong correlation between observed and
simulated values, with an R2 of 0.82. Performance metrics included
an RMSE of 91.6 mV, RRMSE of 24.0%, and NSE of 0.82, indicating
good model accuracy. The Figure 6 explains the relation between
the simulated and observed soil dynamic properties (soil mineral
N, WFPS, soil temperature and Eh) along with the 2-year mean
evaluation statistics.
3.1.2 Rice-wheat system productivity and
nitrogen uptake
During both experimental years, the highest observed and
simulated system productivity (in terms of rice equivalent yield)
was recorded in SSD plots with 100% RDN (12.6 t ha−1 and 13.0 t
ha−1, respectively). Yields in SD and PTR plots with 100% RDN
were comparable in both years. Across treatments, observed and
simulated system yields showed good agreement, though simulated
yields were slightly overpredicted, with an RRMSE of 7.8%. The
model’s accuracy was further validated by a 2-year average RMSE
of 779 kg ha−1 and an R2 of 0.93 (Figure 7; Supplementary Table 5).
In contrast, simulated system N uptake was consistently lower than
observed values, with mean RMSE and RRMSE of 36.4 kg N −1 and
18.1%, respectively, and an R2 of 0.86.
3.2 GHG emissions
Following successful calibration and evaluation, the DNDC
model was used to assess GHG emissions across diﬀerent
crop establishment techniques, irrigation methods, and nitrogen
management treatments as a surrogate approach. Simulated SOC
at the end of each cropping cycle closely matched observed
data, with minimal variation. Among crop establishment methods,
CH4 emissions were highest in PTR plots and lowest in DSR
plots. Within DSR, ﬂood-irrigated plots emitted the highest CH4

emissions, while micro-irrigated plots (SD and SSD) emitted the
lowest (Figure 8; Table 2). N2O emissions were signiﬁcantly higher
in DSR plots, with minimal emissions in PTR plots. N management
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced emissions, with 75% and 100% RDN plots
emitting more CH4 than N control plots, although no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence was observed between the 75% and 100% RDN plots.
N2O emissions were highest in 100% RDN plots, followed by
75% RDN plots, and lowest in N control plots. Yearly variations
showed higher CH4 emissions in 2023–24, likely due to increased
rainfall during the rice season, while N2O emissions were greater
in 2022–23, reﬂecting optimal conditions for denitriﬁcation.
Overall, the GWP was 31% lower in DSR plots compared
to PTR plots, with SD and SSD plots achieving substantial
GWP reductions of 65% and 58%, respectively, compared
to PTR.
3.3 Sensitivity and correlation analysis
The DNDC model’s sensitivity to input parameters, such as
pH, SOC, BD, FC, porosity, microbial activity, residue quantity,
ﬂooding duration, and fertilizer (N and P) application rates
were evaluated for simulating system grain yield, CH4, and
N2O emissions in RWCS under diﬀerent treatments. The model
exhibited varying degrees of sensitivity to these parameters
(Figure 9). Grain yield was highly sensitive to pH (−0.2 to
−0.69), N fertilizer rate (0.13–0.71), and ﬂooding duration (0.48–
0.76). Yield response to N application was signiﬁcant across
treatments except for SSD (0.13). Moderately positive eﬀects on
yield were observed for microbial activity, SOC, BD, and FC,
while residue quantity had negligible impact (Figure 9). CH4
emissions were most sensitive to microbial activity (0.69–1.24),
ﬂooding duration (0.71–0.92), and BD (0.55–0.90), with moderate
responses to SOC, FC, and porosity. N and P application rates,
pH, and residue quantity had moderate eﬀects on CH4 emissions.
N2O emissions showed strong sensitivity to N application rates
(0.44–1.30), SOC (0.58–0.83), BD (0.27–1.20), FC (0.23–0.95),
and microbial activity (0.43–1.00). In contrast, pH, porosity, and
ﬂooding duration negatively inﬂuenced N2O emissions, while
residue quantity and P application rates had negligible impact.
Correlation analysis revealed signiﬁcant interactions between CH4
ﬂux and soil parameters, with strong correlations to WFPS (R2
= 0.84), Eh (R2 = −0.87), and pH (R2 = −0.91), and moderate
correlations with meteorological parameters. Conversely, N2O ﬂux
showed no substantial correlations with soil or weather parameters
(Figure 10).

3.4 Water balance of rice-wheat system
Among all the simulated components of water balance,
transpiration and cumulative evaporation (from both water surface
and soil) were identiﬁed as the primary water loss pathways.
Among crop establishment methods, PTR and ﬂood-irrigated
DSR plots used about 40% of the total water for transpiration,
while SD and SSD plots utilized ∼50% and 64%, respectively.
On a 2-year average, SSD plots exhibited the lowest cumulative
evaporation losses (571.3 mm), followed by SD (721.3 mm). The
highest evaporation losses were recorded in ﬂood-irrigated PTR
(990.2 mm) and DSR (861.5 mm) plots. Leaching losses were
highest in PTR-ﬂooded plots (629.7 mm), followed by DSR-
ﬂooded plots (570.8 mm). In comparison, SD (160.8 mm) and SSD
(163.3 mm) plots had signiﬁcantly lower leaching losses, accounting
for about 10% of total water loss (Table 3). Runoﬀwas minimal
in micro-irrigation systems (∼2%) but highest in PTR (∼7%) and
ﬂood-irrigated DSR (∼5%) plots. MWBE were low and positive in
PTR and DSR-ﬂooded plots, while they were high and negative
in SD and SSD plots, indicating potential overestimation in the
later systems.
3.5 Nitrogen balance under rice-wheat
system
The DNDC model provided insights into the major N losses
(such as denitriﬁcation, volatilization, and leaching) and uptake
patterns in diﬀerent treatments. In addition to fertilizer N, the
model accounted for ∼30 kg N ha−1 from residue retention in
all plots except control plots (∼10 kg N ha−1; Table 4). Further,
during the rice-growing season, an additional 10–20 kg N ha−1 was
contributed through atmospheric N ﬁxation, which was a model
default value, and it depends on the soil, atmosphere and growing
conditions of the rice crop. Gaseous N losses (N2O, NO, and N2)
reached up to 4 kg ha−1 across all treatments. N2 accounted for a
signiﬁcant portion of total gaseous losses, especially in PTR plots,
where N2O losses were relatively low. N leaching was ∼3.0 kg N
ha−1 across most treatments but increased to ∼6.0 kg N ha−1 in
SSD plots with 100% RDN. NH3–N volatilization was a major loss
pathway, ranging from 21%−27% of total N input in PTR plots
to 33%−40% in DSR ﬂood-irrigated plots. SD plots also had high
NH3–N losses (34%−39%), while SSD plots recorded substantially
lower losses (∼11%; Table 4). The MNBE revealed higher negative

DSR-ZTW-F-100 achieved mid-level rankings, outperforming
conventional PTR systems due to improved proﬁtability and
resource use eﬃciency. Conventional practices (PTR-ZTW-F-75
and PTR-ZTW-F-100) ranked lowest, reﬂecting their limitations
in reducing GHG emissions, high water use, and poor nitrogen
eﬃciency (Figure 11). These results highlight the potential of CA
practices, particularly those integrating DSR with drip fertigation,
to optimize productivity and proﬁtability while minimizing
environmental impacts.
4 Discussion
4.1 Model calibration
Calibrating the DNDC model is crucial for adapting it to
local conditions, given the variability in crop types, management
practices, and environmental conditions. Originally designed
for temperate climates, parameters such as thermal degree
days, optimum temperature, biomass fractions, and C/N ratio
must be adjusted for sub-tropical conditions in South-East
Asia. Accurate calibration ensures precise simulation of crop
growth, nutrient dynamics, and GHG emissions (Zhang and
Niu, 2016). In this study, the model was successfully calibrated

for diﬀerent soil parameters (mineral N, WFPS, Eh, soil
temperature), crop yield, and N uptake, aligning well with
experimental observations.
4.2 Evaluation of the DNDC model
4.2.1 Soil parameters
The higher simulated levels of soil inorganic N during the
growing season, with NH+
4 and NO−
3 concentrations 27% and 5%
higher than observed values, may be due to slower N transport
and transformation processes. This discrepancy likely stems from
suboptimal simulation of key processes, including mineralization,
nitriﬁcation, denitriﬁcation, and NO−
3 leaching (Abdalla et al.,
2020). The model may also underestimate N immobilization in
CA systems, as noted by Brilli et al. (2017). Moreover, higher
simulated WFPS appears to have inhibited nitriﬁcation and slowed
NO−
3 transport between soil layers, increasing NH+
4 and NO−
3
concentrations (Drury et al., 2024). High RRMSE of 53% for
NO−
3 and 64% for NH+
4 further highlight these issues, consistent
with previous studies (Abdalla et al., 2014; Uzoma et al., 2015;
He et al., 2018; Jiang R. et al., 2019). As this study only
assessed soil N at a single depth, proﬁle-wide accuracy remains
uncertain, underscoring the need for improved algorithms to
better simulate nitrogen dynamics in systems with continuous
cropping. Further, DNDC model satisfactorily simulated WFPS
across diﬀerent crop establishment techniques, irrigation methods,
and nitrogen management treatments, though with slightly less
accuracy than soil temperature in the 0 cm−5 cm depth. Consistent
with Macharia et al. (2021), the model overestimated WFPS,
particularly in control N treatments, likely due to uncertainties
in estimating potential evapotranspiration and underestimating
crop canopy interception of soil water (Krobel et al., 2010;
Uzoma et al., 2015). Similar overestimations have been reported
in diverse cropping systems (Abdalla et al., 2014; Cui et al.,
2014; Li et al., 2017). Improving the DNDC water module,
crop-speciﬁc root distribution algorithms, and soil heterogeneity
simulation is necessary for better accuracy (Smith et al., 2019).
WFPS signiﬁcantly inﬂuences soil conditions, promoting anaerobic
conditions that increase CH4 production through methanogenesis
(Ussiri and Lal, 2012), while reducing N2O emissions through
enhanced water use and lower gas diﬀusivity (Kuang et al., 2019).

The plots visualize the correlation between the observed and simulated data points for (A) soil NO−
3 , (B) soil NH+
4 , (C) soil temperature, (D) WFPS, and
(E) redox potential, respectively.
The DNDC model eﬀectively simulates soil temperature,
primarily due to its robust representation of heat transfer processes
between soil layers, driven by thermal conductivity, temperature
gradients, and soil heat capacity (Zhang et al., 2021). This
aligns with ﬁndings by Cui et al. (2014) and Li et al. (2017),
who reported strong correlations (R2: 0.97–1.0 and 0.89–0.97,
respectively) between simulated and observed soil temperatures.
In wet soils during the rice season, increased heat capacity results
in fewer temperature ﬂuctuations, improving prediction accuracy
compared to dry-season wheat. However, the present study
observed frequent overpredictions, with a RRMSE of 4.6%, likely
due to overestimating crop residue insulation and underestimating
cumulative crop canopy eﬀects (Jiang et al., 2023). Similar
overestimations (2%−6%) were reported by Li et al. (2017), whereas
Smith et al. (2008) and Uzoma et al. (2015) noted underestimations
(5%−8%) under diﬀerent agroecological conditions. Accurate soil
temperature simulation is critical for modeling CH4 and N2O
emissions, as it inﬂuences SOC decomposition, water dynamics,
microbial activity, and plant growth processes (Wennman and
Kätterer, 2006; Hu et al., 2012). Model overestimated Eh, with
a mean simulated value of 432 mV compared to the observed
381 mV. While observed Eh showed gradual changes with soil
drainage or re-ﬂooding (Islam et al., 2018), the model simulated
Eh with abrupt changes, likely contributing to this discrepancy.
The DNDC model estimates Eh using the Nernst equation, which
depends on oxidation-reduction reactions inﬂuenced by WFPS (Li
et al., 1992b). Overestimated WFPS as discussed earlier in this
section, likely contributed to this overestimation. Since, Eh is a key
factor aﬀecting GHG emissions and is critical for simulating carbon
and N dynamics in cropping systems (Tao et al., 2024). Enhancing
the accuracy of Eh simulations is essential for improving overall
model performance.

4.2.2 System yield and n uptake
Overall, the model eﬀectively simulated system yields. In
ﬂooded DSR and PTR plots, system yields were consistently
overestimated across all N-applied treatments, though the model
captured yield variations at diﬀerent N rates well. Possible
reasons include simpliﬁcation of soil microbial dynamics and root
interactions, inadequate local calibration and mainly, the exclusion
of stress factors like pests, and diseases (Jiang R. et al., 2019;
Zhao et al., 2020). Conversely, the model underestimated yields in
micro-irrigation treatments (SD and SSD), likely due to its inability
to fully capture and represent the enhanced N and water use
eﬃciency in drip fertigation systems. Meta-analyses indicate that
surface and subsurface drip fertigation can boost yields by 20% and
32%, respectively, through improved resource eﬃciencies (Bhuiyan
et al., 2023; Delbaz et al., 2023). Model’s N uptake predictions
were consistently underestimated, with a mean RMSE of 36.4 kg N
ha−1. This discrepancy may stem from simplistic representations
of N transformation processes, overestimating losses like leaching
and volatilization, consequently leading to lower predicted uptake
(Abdalla et al., 2022). Additionally, higher simulated mineral
N availability with lower uptake could explain the results, as
noted in Section 3.5. To improve accuracy, the DNDC model
requires enhancements in its algorithms for crop growth, nutrient
uptake, and their interactions under diverse environmental and
management conditions (Li et al., 2022).

2023; Jiang et al., 2023). DNDC models CH4 emissions by

through intricate soil, plant, and atmospheric interactions.

CH4 production is driven by substrate availability from SOC
decomposition and root activities. This was followed by reductive
reactions between electron donors and acceptors when soil Eh
falls below −150 mV under saturated conditions (Li et al., 2004;
Hakemain and Rosenzweig, 2007). SOC decomposition generates
DOC, inﬂuenced by soil temperature and moisture (Li et al., 1992a,
2012). CH4 consumption occurs via oxidation reactions involving
electron exchange between CH4 and oxygen, while transport
involves plant-mediated pathways, eﬀusion, and diﬀusion (Fumoto
et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2014). N2O emissions are regulated by
nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation processes, activated when soil Eh
is below +500 mV and moisture is under 60% WFPS, with NO−
3
acting as a substrate (Jamali et al., 2016).
During the experimental period, prolonged saturation in PTR
plots resulted in higher CH4 emissions and lower N2O emissions.
Conversely, DSR-ﬂooded, SD, and SSD plots exhibited higher
N2O and lower CH4 emissions due to reduced soil moisture
(Johnson-Beebout et al., 2009; Reddy et al., 2025). Control
treatments showed lower CH4 emissions compared to 75% and
100% RDN treatments, as the model correlates emissions with
above-ground and root biomass. By accurately capturing the
dynamics of soil moisture, temperature, mineral N, Eh, and
plant growth, the DNDC model provides realistic estimates of
GHG emissions.
4.4 Sensitivity and correlation analysis
Sensitivity analysis is a key component of the study, enabling
identiﬁcation of critical parameters inﬂuencing carbon and N
dynamics in agroecosystems. Increasing soil pH reduces proton
(H+) activity, promoting volatilization through transformation

to NH3 and creating less favorable conditions for
denitriﬁcation, thereby lowering N2O emissions (Ingraham and
Salas, 2019). However, higher soil pH often results in yield penalties
due to reduced macro- and micronutrient availability and increased
nutrient losses. The slightly alkaline nature of the experimental
soil suppressed CH4 emissions, consistent with ﬁndings by Malyan
et al. (2016), though some studies report negligible eﬀects of pH
on CH4 emissions (Guo et al., 2023). SOC and microbial activity
were positively sensitive to system yield and GHG emissions.
SOC enhances N mineralization, increasing soil N availability and
contributing to higher emissions of N2O and CH4. Increased N
availability enhances nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation, raising N2O
emissions (Ding et al., 2023). Higher SOC levels in anaerobic rice
ﬁelds support methanogenic bacteria, enabling CH4 production,
while also improving nutrient availability, soil structure, and
microbial activity for better root growth and productivity (Jiang
et al., 2023). Moderate increases in soil BD and FC enhance yields
by improving moisture retention and nutrient uptake but create
anaerobic conditions, increasing N2O and CH4 emissions (Gheisari
et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Compacted soils restrict root
growth, while higher porosity in drip-fertigated systems boosts
yield. Mixed ﬁndings on the eﬀects of soil compaction on GHG
emissions highlights the need for further investigations (Schmidt
et al., 2018; Cui and Wang, 2019).
Crop residue or straw incorporation slightly reduces system
yield due to N immobilization during early decomposition,
temporarily limiting its availability to plants (Islam et al., 2022).
Balanced carbon and N inputs from straw may stabilize microbial
processes, leading to negligible eﬀects on soil N2O emissions
(Chen et al., 2014). Upland conditions and increased methanotroph
activity can oﬀset straw-mediated CH4 emissions, preventing a
net increase (Zou et al., 2004). Flooding duration signiﬁcantly
aﬀects rice yield and GHG emissions. Extended ﬂooding promotes
anaerobic conditions, resulting in higher CH4 emissions and lower
N2O emissions (Arenas-Calle et al., 2024). These conditions also
enhance rice productivity by improving nutrient availability and
suppressing weed competition, creating an optimal environment
for rice growth (Sudhir-Yadav et al., 2011).
Higher N application signiﬁcantly boosts system yield but
also increases CH4 and N2O emissions. As the most limiting
nutrient, N enhances plant growth by improving photosynthetic
and metabolic rates, resulting in higher yields (Li et al., 1992b).
However, excessive N application stimulates nitriﬁcation and
denitriﬁcation, exponentially increasing cumulative and yield-
scaled N2O emissions beyond the optimal rate (Song X. et al., 2019).
Elevated N inputs also lower the C:N ratio, enhancing substrate
decomposition, increasing DOC availability for methanogens, and
raising CH4 production (Fumoto et al., 2008; Drury et al., 2024).
Enhanced plant growth further facilitates CH4 transport to the
atmosphere. In contrast, P application has minimal eﬀects on
yield and emissions in non-limiting soils. Additional P supply
does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence crop productivity or processes like
denitriﬁcation and methanogenesis, leading to negligible changes
in CH4 and N2O emissions (Song T. et al., 2019; Gebremichael
et al., 2022).
High WFPS promotes soil saturation and anaerobic conditions,
creating an ideal environment for methanogenesis. Similarly, low
Eh values indicate reduced conditions favoring methanogens,
which thrive in the absence of electron acceptors like O2 (Li et al.,
1992a). High soil pH (>8.8) negatively correlates with CH4 ﬂux,
as it aﬀects substrate availability (acetate and hydrogen), which
are essential for methanogenesis (Malyan et al., 2016). Further,
alkaline conditions also enhance sulfate-reducing bacteria activity,
competing with methanogens for hydrogen and reducing CH4
production (Malyan et al., 2016). N2O ﬂux showed poor correlation
with soil and weather parameters, contrary to studies linking it to
NO−
3 -N, NH+
4 -N, and WFPS (Jiang R. et al., 2019; Wu et al.,
2023). This discrepancy likely stems from prolonged saturated and

anaerobic conditions during the rice season, which reduce N2O
emissions by favoring complete denitriﬁcation to N2 and lowering
NO−
3 availability (Gupta et al., 2016).
4.5 Water balance
The DNDC model reliably predicted water balance, accurately
simulating WFPS (%) at regular intervals. In ﬂooded PTR and
DSR plots, high irrigation levels resulted in high evaporation
losses (Mousavi et al., 2009). Conversely, micro-irrigated systems
(SD, SSD) exhibited lower evaporation losses due to controlled
irrigation. Transpiration losses correlated with plant growth
and yield, as higher biomass production required increased
transpiration (Rana et al., 2023). Leaching losses were higher
in ﬂooded systems due to excess irrigation beyond saturation
(Sudhir-Yadav et al., 2011). Although previous studies suggest
higher leaching in DSR compared to PTR due to the absence
of puddling, the model showed similar losses in both systems,
likely due to limited irrigation and silty loam soil texture with
low hydraulic conductivity (Jiang Y. et al., 2019). Leaching
and evapotranspiration losses observed were lower and more
consistent than in continuous ﬂooding systems reported for
similar regions (Sudhir-Yadav et al., 2011). Water savings from
alternate wetting and drying, compared to continuous ﬂooding,
were primarily due to reduced deep drainage with minimal
impact on evapotranspiration (Arora, 2006; Belder et al., 2007;
Bouman et al., 2007). In micro-irrigation systems, frequent
but limited water applications minimized leaching and runoﬀ,
except during precipitation events (Patra K. et al., 2023).
Whereas in ﬂood-irrigated DSR and PTR plots, signiﬁcant runoﬀ
occurred although the model did not fully capture these losses.
The model failed to predict the seepage losses, even though
these losses might be minimal. Positive and negative MWBEs
observed in ﬂooded and micro-irrigated plots may stem from
structural uncertainties and suboptimal water budgeting by
the model.

volatilization losses under high soil temperature and moisture
following N application. Urea hydrolysis, driven by urease activity,
is inﬂuenced by soil pH, temperature, and moisture, with higher
pH accelerating NH3 volatilization (Cabrera et al., 1991; Kissel
et al., 2008; Fisher et al., 2017). Flood and SD-irrigated DSR
plots experienced higher volatilization losses than ﬂood-irrigated
PTR plots, as puddling in PTR neutralized soil pH, reducing
volatilization losses. The slightly alkaline soil conditions in DSR
plots further intensiﬁed volatilization (Gupta et al., 2016). SSD
systems, however, reduced volatilization losses by 76% compared to
surface-applied ﬂooded DSR systems, aligning with meta-analyses
showing up to 86% reduction of NH3 volatilization in paddy crops
with SSD fertigation (Bhuiyan et al., 2023). Leaching losses were
low in surface-applied systems (0.7 kg N ha−1−2.9 kg N ha−1),
attributed to high volatilization and low N availability. In SSD
systems, leaching losses were higher (4.0 kg N ha−1–6.9 kg N
ha−1), especially at 100% RDN, due to subsurface application and
reduced volatilization (Drury et al., 2024). Higher N application
(100% RDN) also increased gaseous N losses due to lower N
use eﬃciency. PTR plots exhibited higher denitriﬁcation under
anaerobic conditions, reducing NO−
3 to N2, resulting in cumulative
gaseous losses comparable to those in DSR systems, despite DSR
having higher N2O emissions (Zhao et al., 2020). The MNBE was
high in 75% RDN-treated plots but low in 100% RDN-treated
plots, indicating the model’s limitations in accurately capturing N
use eﬃciency at varying application rates.
4.7 TOPSIS ranking for sustainability
evaluation
Adoption of DSR with SSD under CA emerged as the most
eﬃcient system, combining high productivity, reduced GHG
emissions, improved nitrogen uptake, and lower water use. This
eﬃciency is further ampliﬁed by a ∼25% reduction in N application
without much compromising with productivity, showcasing
signiﬁcant input savings and environmental beneﬁts. These
ﬁndings align with previous studies indicating that SSD systems
enhance resource productivity by minimizing evaporation leaching
and volatilization losses while improving nutrient availability in the
root zone (Bhuiyan et al., 2023; Rana et al., 2023). The meta-analysis
conducted by Bhuiyan et al. (2023) also states that SSD can save 30%
of N without yield penalty and lowers GHG emissions. Similarly,
SD treatments demonstrated strong performance, supporting
the eﬃcacy of micro-irrigation technologies in reducing non-
productive water losses and addressing nitrogen ineﬃciencies
(Delbaz et al., 2023). In contrast, conventional systems such as
PTR with ﬂood irrigation ranked lowest due to their resource-
intensive nature. High water use, signiﬁcant nitrogen volatilization
and elevated GHG emissions, primarily CH4 due to prolonged
anaerobic conditions, have been widely documented in these
systems (Kissel et al., 2008; Sudhir-Yadav et al., 2011; Schmidt
et al., 2018). These limitations highlight the pressing need of
transitioning to low-emission systems such as DSR. However,
DSR with traditional ﬂooding alone is insuﬃcient. To fully realize
the potential of DSR, integrating it with CA and precision
irrigation methods like SSD is essential to enhance resource
eﬃciency, maximize nitrogen uptake, and ensure environmental
sustainability (Sidhu et al., 2019; Patra K. et al., 2023). This
integrated approach oﬀers a scalable solution to address challenges
in resource-constrained agricultural ecosystems.
Thus, optimizing yield emission trade-oﬀs in the RWCS
enhances system resilience in terms of productivity, proﬁtability
and environmental sustainability. By this way, utilization of DNDC
model insights into eco-optimization of the RWCS can be an
important tool in evaluating the overall sustainability of the
agricultural system.

environmental impacts in a 5-year long RWCS experiment
in the eastern IGPs of India. The calibrated model eﬀectively
simulated soil mineral N (NO−
3
and NH+
4 ), WFPS, Eh, soil
temperature, system yield, and nitrogen uptake with reasonable
accuracy. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of
soil and management factors in maintaining a yield-emission
balance. Integrating resource-conserving technologies like CA,
drip fertigation, and DSR improved productivity and resource
eﬃciency while reducing CH4 emissions by 70%−80%. Although
N2O emissions increased 2.5 times, the overall GWP was reduced
by 58%−65%, showcasing the environmental beneﬁts of these
technologies. The TOPSIS analysis further supported the ﬁeld
results, ranking DSR-ZTW-SSD system as the most sustainable
treatment, achieving the highest grain yields, improved nitrogen
uptake, reduced GHG emissions, and minimized water losses.
Despite the model’s robust performance, further reﬁnement
is required to adapt its algorithms to tropical and subtropical
conditions. This study emphasizes the potential of integrating
CA, drip fertigation, and DSR to enhance yields, conserve
resources, and lower GWP, thereby ensuring the sustainability
of RWCS in the challenging agroecological zones like the
eastern IGP.
