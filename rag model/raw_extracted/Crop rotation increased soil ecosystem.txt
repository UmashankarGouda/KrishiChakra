Continuous cropping of the same crop leads to soil degradation and a decline in
crop production, and these impacts could be mitigated through rotation cropping.
Although crop rotation enhances soil fertility, microbial community diversity, and
potato yield, its effects on the soil ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) remain
unclear. In the present research, we comparatively examined the effects of potato
continuous cropping (PP) and rotation cropping [potato–oat rotation (PO) and
potato–forage maize rotation (PFM)] on the soil EMF as well as the roles of keystone
taxa, microbes abundance, and chemical properties in EMF improvement. It was
demonstrated that soil EMF is increased in rotation cropping (PO and PFM) than
PP. Soil pH was higher in rotation cropping (PO and PFM) than in PP, while total
phosphorus (TP) and available phosphorus (AP) were signiﬁcantly decreased than that
in PP. Rotation cropping (PO and PFM) markedly changed the bacterial and fungal
community compositions, and improved the potential plant-beneﬁcial fungi, e.g.,
Schizothecium and Chaetomium, while reducing the abundances of the potentially
phytopathogenic fungi, e.g., Alternaria, Fusarium, Verticillium dahiae, Gibberella,
Plectosphaerella, Colletotrichum, Phoma, and Lectera in comparison with PP. Also,
co-occurrence patterns for bacteria and fungi were impacted by crop rotation,
and keystone taxa, e.g., Nitrospira.1, Lysinibacillus, Microlunatus.1, Sphingomonas.3,
Bryobacter.1, Micromonospora, and Schizothecium, were enriched in PO and PFM
than PP. The structural equation model (SEM) further demonstrated that cropping
systems increased soil ecosystem multifunctionality through regulating SOM and
keystone taxa (Schizothecium1), and keystone taxa were mediated by soil pH. This
study suggested that rotation cropping might contribute to the improvement of soil
ecosystem multifunctionality as well as the development of disease-suppressive soils
in comparison with potato continuous cropping.

1. Introduction
Potato (Solanum tuberosum), one of the most important crops in
the world, plays an irreplaceable role in ensuring world food security
and promoting economic development (Gustavsen, 2021). Because of
the limited cultivated area and economic interest, potato continuous
cropping within the same ﬁeld has become a very widespread
problem (Zhou et al., 2019). Long-term continuous potato cropping
results in soil-borne diseases, including common scab, black scurf
disease, blackleg, and fusarium wilt, which lead to a reduction in
potato productivity and sustainable health development (Xu et al.,
2022), and biotic factors are the major causes for soil-borne diseases
(Dias et al., 2015). In order to control these diseases, fungicides are
extensively used in potato production to prevent and control those
soil-borne diseases and maintain suﬃcient crop yield and product
quality (Al-Mughrabi et al., 2015), while they can also cause serious
risks to the environment and human health (Tan et al., 2020).
Rotation cropping is a safe and eﬀective measure that can
improve soil productivity, reduce pathogens, control plant soil-borne
diseases, and increase yields in comparison with continuous cropping
(Larkin and Halloran, 2014; Ashworth et al., 2020). Previous studies
have suggested that potato–corn/green manure rotation provided
higher tuber yield via enhancing abundances of some beneﬁcial
microbes (e.g., Sphingomonas, Haliangium, Gemmatimonas, and
Pseudogymnoascus), while decreasing the abundances of pathogenic
microbes (e.g., Fusarium, Stagonosporopsis, Alternaria, Lectera,
Fusaria, and Mortierell) and autotoxic substances (Qin et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2022). Long-time rotation cropping improved microbial
community composition and enhanced soil health which eventually
contributed to improved plant growth. Thus, maintaining the potato
production system is closely associated with improving diverse and
functional soil microbial communities (Hiltunen et al., 2021).
Soil microbes (bacteria and fungi) play a crucial role in the
agroecosystem, as they participate in material cycling and organic
matter decomposition (Liu et al., 2019), and are vital and decisive
factors in plant health and productivity (Guo et al., 2021). Keystone
taxa play a role in biological connectivity and may be considered
indicative markers of community migration and compositional
rollover, which have the largest inﬂuence on microbial community
and ecosystem functionality (Vick-Majors et al., 2014; Banerjee et al.,
2016a, 2018). Previous studies have demonstrated that keystone taxa
can have signiﬁcant eﬀects on soil quality improvement, carbon
transformation, and organic compound degradation (Banerjee et al.,
2016b; Yan et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022). Agricultural management,
e.g., tillage practices, that eﬀectively aﬀect keystone taxa, also
inﬂuence soil quality and ecosystem multifunctionality (Liu et al.,
2022). However, the responses of soil ecosystem multifunctionality,
microbial co-occurrence network, patterns, and keystone taxa to
diﬀerent cropping systems remain unclear.
Soil ecosystem multifunctionality motivated by soil microbes
is
important
for
maintaining
the
cycling
of
nutrients,
the
decomposition of organic matter, and plant productivity (Bardgett
and van der Putten, 2014; Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2016). Previous
studies have shown that soil multifunctionality (e.g., C and N cycling)
was aﬀected by microbial community composition, diversity, and soil
environment (e.g., pH and SOC) (Zheng et al., 2019). Agricultural
management practices can enhance ecosystem services function
and maintain ecosystem multifunctionality (Ryan et al., 2018).
Recent studies have shown that intercropping can increase the soil
ecosystem multifunctionality by improving available nutrients (Ma
et al., 2022). It remains incompletely understood, however, whether
the alterations in soil chemical properties aﬀected by crop rotation
aﬀect the co-occurrence patterns of microbes and the relationship
between keystone taxa and soil ecosystem multifunctionality.
In
the
present
research,
we
comparatively
explored
the
diﬀerences in soil chemical properties [pH, total nitrogen (TN),
alkali hydrolyzable nitrogen (AN), organic matter (SOM), total
phosphorus (TP), and available phosphorus (AP)], bacterial and
fungal community compositions, co-occurrence patterns, keystone
taxa, and ecosystem multifunctionality between potato continuous
cropping (PP) and rotation cropping [potato–oat rotation (PO)
and potato–forage maize rotation (PFM)]. The aims of the present
study were to (1) investigate the responses of soil ecosystem
multifunctionality,
microbial
community
composition,
co-
occurrence network patterns, and keystone taxa to diﬀerent cropping
systems; (2) determine how the keystone taxa, microbes abundance,
and chemical properties aﬀect soil ecosystem multifunctionality
under diﬀerent cropping systems.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study site description
The study was conducted at the Zhangbei Agricultural Resource
and Ecological Environment Key Field Research Station, Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Aﬀairs, Zhangjiakou, Hebei, China (41◦09’N,
114◦42’E). The study site is situated at an elevation of 1,420 m, with a
mean annual temperature of 3.9◦C and a mean annual precipitation
record of 382.5 mm. The soil type is meadow chestnut soil with a
pH of 7.7, organic matter 18.53 g kg−1, alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen
80.68 mg kg−1, total nitrogen 1.09 g kg−1, available phosphorus
34.10 mg kg−1, total phosphorus 0.54 g kg−1, available potassium
76.63 mg kg−1, and total potassium 22.03 g kg−1 (Yao et al., 2020).
Three treatments were used during the growing seasons from
2015 to 2021. Treatments used in this study include potato (Solanum
tuberosum) continuous cropping (PP), potato–oat (Avena sativa)
rotation (PO), and potato–forage maize (Zea mays) rotation (PFM).
Three 20 m × 6 m experimental plots were established and treated
as the three treatments described earlier. There were ﬁve pseudo-
replicates within each experimental plot, and the size of each replicate
plot was 4 m × 6 m. Fertilizers were used as basal fertilizers before
sowing, with no irrigation throughout the crop growth period. The
detailed experimental treatments are shown in Figure 1.
2.2. Soil sampling
After the harvest of potatoes, a total of 15 bulk soil samples (three
treatments × ﬁve replicates) were collected with a 2-cm-diameter
auger on 14 October 2021. For the bulk soils, 10 topsoil samples
(0–20 cm) were randomly collected from each replicate plot and
combined into a single sample (a replicate). Each composite sample
(a replicate) was divided into two parts, where the ﬁrst part was
stored at –80◦C before DNA extraction, and the second part was air-
dried at room temperature for determining soil chemical properties
[pH, total nitrogen (TN), alkali hydrolyzable nitrogen (AN), organic
matter (SOM), total phosphorus (TP), and available phosphorus
(AP)], enzyme activities [β-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), β-
1,4-glucosidase (β-GC), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)].

2.3. Microbial DNA extraction, PCR
ampliﬁcation, and Illumina MiSeq
Total soil genomic DNA was extracted from 0.5 g of soil
using the E.Z.N.A.
R⃝soil DNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA,
USA). The DNA extract was checked on 1% agarose gel, and
DNA concentration and purity were determined with NanoDrop
2000 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Wilmington,
USA). Bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments were performed using
the general bacterial primers 338F–806R, which are speciﬁc to
the V3–V4 hypervariable region (Wang et al., 2018). The ITS
region was targeted with the primers ITS1F–ITS2R (Kerfahi et al.,
2016). The adaptor and primer sequences were trimmed using
the cutadapt plugin. The quality control and identiﬁcation of
amplicon sequence variants were performed using the DADA2
plugin (Callahan et al., 2016) according to the standard protocols
by Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Through quality trimming (using Btrim to remove sequencing
adaptors and low-quality regions), merging, and clustering (using the
CD-HIT algorithm), samples were rareﬁed to a depth of 52,460 and
38,494 sequences per sample of bacterial and fungal communities,
respectively, and clustered into 47,678 and 38,064 operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) of bacterial and fungal communities,
respectively, by a 97% similarity cutoﬀusing UPARSE version
7.1 (Edgar, 2013). The taxonomy of each OTU representative
sequence was analyzed by RDP Classiﬁer version 2.2 (Wang
et al., 2007) using a conﬁdence threshold of 0.7. The raw data
of bacterial and fungal sequences were deposited into the NCBI
Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under the following accession
numbers: SRR22669278-22669292 (bacteria), and SRR22703913-
22703927 (fungi).
2.4. Soil chemical properties, enzyme
activities, and soil ecosystem
multifunctionality analysis
Soil pH was determined in a mixture of water and soil suspension
(2.5:1) with an electrode method. TN was done by measuring the
residual ammonia by the Kjeldahl method. AN was determined by
the alkaline diﬀusion method. TP was determined by Mo–Sb anti-
spectrophotometric method. AP was extracted by the diacid method
and determined by the molybdenum–antimony colorimetry. SOM
was measured by the potassium dichromate external heating method.
Soil analyses (pH, TN, AN, TP, AP, and SOM) procedures were
conducted as detailed by Bao (2000).
Enzymatic activities of NAG and β-GC were determined by the
colorimetric method, and ALP was measured using the disodium
phenyl phosphate colorimetric method (Sinsabaugh et al., 2008).
Soil multifunctionality was assessed based on three soil functional
attributes associated with the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and
phosphorus (P) cycles. NAG, TN, and AN for the N cycle;
β-GC and organic matter for the C cycle; ALP, TP, and AP for
the P cycle. Single soil functions were normalized with Z-score
transformation and averaged to calculate the multifunctionality
(Guo et al., 2021).
2.5. Statistical analyses
One-way ANOVA was employed to determine the eﬀects of
diﬀerent cropping systems (PP, PO, and PFM) on the soil chemical
properties, multifunctionality, and the abundance of the potential
plant-beneﬁcial and phytopathogenic microbes, and signiﬁcant
diﬀerences were analyzed by Duncan’s new multiple diﬀerences
test at a P-value of < 0.05. Data were tested for normality and
homogeneity of variance before conducting ANOVA and were log-
transformed when needed. The Pearson correlation coeﬃcient was
used to determine the possible association among soil microbes,
soil chemical properties, and ecosystem multifunctionality. SPSS 22.0
software was used for statistical analyses.
Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was calculated by the
“vegan 3.3.1” package in R. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
eﬀect size (LEfSe) was conducted to illustrate the biomarkers in
each treatment. Those with an LDA score of ≥2.5 for bacteria
and ≥4.0 for fungi were considered to be important biomarkers
in each treatment.
Co-occurrence network analysis of microbial communities at
the genus level using high-throughput sequencing data and the
relative abundance of a genus of > 0.1% was used in the analyses.
A correlation matrix was analyzed using the “psych” package in the
R environment and the co-occurrence network visualization was
achieved via Gephi (version 0.9.2). Spearman correlations between
genera were performed, and the correlations with a coeﬃcient
of more than 0.6 and a P-value of less than 0.05 were applied.
Microbial community networks were built according to MENAP

(Wu et al., 2021a).1 The topological roles of individual nodes in the
network were decided by the threshold values of Zi and Pi (Ling et al.,
2016; Han et al., 2022). Nodes were classiﬁed into four categories:
peripherals (Zi < 2.5 and Pi < 0.62), connectors (Zi < 2.5 and
Pi > 0.62), module hubs (Zi > 2.5 and Pi < 0.62), and network
hubs (Zi > 2.5 and Pi > 0.62). The nodes assigned to the network
connector, module hub, and hub were the generalists that may be
paralleled to key organisms in the microbial community as predicted
by the network theory (Han et al., 2022).
A structural equation model was performed to assess the direct
and indirect eﬀects of cropping systems, soil pH, SOM, keystone
taxa (Schizothecium1 abundance), and potentially phytopathogenic
microbes on the soil ecosystem multifunctionality (C and N cycling)
using IBM SPSS AMOS 21. Before the SEM analysis, we integrated the
relative abundances of potentially phytopathogenic fungi [Alternaria
(Wang et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022), Fusarium (Zhang et al.,
2017), Verticillium dahliae (Zhao et al., 2021), Gibberella (Li et al.,
2022), Plectosphaerella (Xu et al., 2014), Colletotrichum (Cuevas-
Fernández et al., 2022), Phoma (Wunsch and Bergstrom, 2011), and
Lectera (Cannon et al., 2012)] through the principal component
analyses (PCA). The ﬁrst principal component (PC1) was used in
the subsequent SEM analysis to represent soil pathogenic microbe
abundance. Suﬃcient model ﬁts of the structural equation models by
χ2/df (1 ≤χ2/df ≤3 and 0.05 < P ≤1.00) and root mean square
error of approximation (0 ≤RMSEA ≤0.08) were used (Delgado-
Baquerizo et al., 2016). The standardized total eﬀect of each variable
on the soil ecosystem multifunctionality was also determined for the
structural equation model.
3. Results
3.1. Soil ecosystem multifunctionality and
chemical properties
The response of the changes in soil ecosystem multifunctionality
to diﬀerent cropping systems is presented in Table 1. Soil
multifunctionality of crop rotation (PO and PFM) soils was higher
than those of PP soils (P = 0.069). Speciﬁcally, soil multifunctionality
related to the C cycle (P < 0.001) and single soil functions β-GC
(P < 0.001) were increased in the crop rotation (PO and PFM) soils
than those of PP soils. Soil multifunctionality related to the N cycle
(P = 0.002) and single soil functions NAG (P < 0.001) were increased
in the crop rotation (PO and PFM) soils than those of PP soils. In
contrast, single functions TP (P < 0.001) and AP (P < 0.001) relating
to the soil P cycle were decreased in the crop rotation (PO and PFM)
soils than the PP soils. Compared to PP, crop rotation increased soil
pH (P < 0.001), and PFM also increased pH relative to PO. PO, but
not PFM, also increased SOM (P = 0.002), TN (P = 0.055), and C/N
(P = 0.029) than PP.
3.2. Composition of microbial community
We sequenced the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene for 15
samples and obtained a total of 980,851 high-quality sequence reads
1
http://ieg2.ou.edu/MENA/main.cgi
that ranged from 52,460 to 80,674, with an average read length of
417 bp. The fungal ITS sequences totaled 754,215, and the number of
sequences obtained from each sample ranged from 38,494 to 73,983,
with an average read length of 237 bp (Supplementary Table 1).
The disparities in the structures of soil bacterial and fungal
communities from diﬀerent cropping systems were analyzed by
PCoA, and the structures of the microbial communities among
continuous cropping and rotational cropping were signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent (Figure 2). The ﬁrst two principal component axes
explained 18.67% (PC1) and 11.72% (PC2) of the variation in the
bacterial community. The PO and PFM were clustered together, and
were separated from PP along the PC2 axis (ANOSIM R = 0.2418,
P = 0.001) (Figure 2A). Similar to the soil bacterial community, crop
rotation also changed the fungal community structure. The ﬁrst two
principal component axes explained 17.15% (PC1) and 12.94% (PC2)
of the variation in the fungal community. The fungal communities
in soil from the PP treatment were separated from that of the PO
and PFM treatments along the PC1 axis, and the PO was separated
from the PFM along the PC2 axis (ANOSIM R = 0.7769, P = 0.001)
(Figure 2C).
For the bacterial community, nine groups were described with
an average relative abundance of > 1% at the phylum level. The
dominant taxa in soil mainly included Actinobacteriota (33.32%),
Proteobacteria
(19.79%),
Chloroﬂexi
(13.20%),
Acidobacteriota
(10.40%),
Firmicutes
(6.79%),
Gemmatimonadota
(5.11%),
Bacteroidota (3.20%), Myxococcota (2.37%), and Methylomirabilota
(1.05%) (Figure 2B). Crop rotation shifted the dominant bacterial
groups in comparison with PP. Dominant groups were displayed
in cladograms, and LDA scores greater than or equal to 2.5 were
conﬁrmed by LEfSe (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 1A).
Cyanobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Bacilli performed major
roles in PP, PO, and PFM, respectively. In addition, potential plant-
beneﬁcial bacteria Bacillus (P = 0.008) and Pseudomonas (P = 0.001),
which are widely used for controlling plant diseases (Jiang et al.,
2017; Wei et al., 2018), were in greater abundance in PFM than in PP
and PO. In contrast, Streptomyces scabiei, which causes potato scab,
was lower in abundance in PFM than in PP and PO, but there was no
signiﬁcant change between PP and PO (Table 2).
For the fungal community, the dominant phyla predominantly
consisted of Ascomycota (81.36%), Mortierellomycota (10.30%), and
Basidiomycota (6.19%) (Figure 2D). Crop rotation also shifted the
dominant fungal groups in comparison with PP. Dominant groups
were revealed in cladograms, and LDA scores greater than or equal
to 4.0 were determined by LEfSe (Figure 3B and Supplementary
Figure 1B). Nectriaceae, Chaetomium, and Basidiomycota, as the
main dominant taxa, play key roles in PP, PO, and PFM, respectively.
In addition, rotation cropping increased the potential plant-beneﬁcial
fungi abundance in comparison with PP (Table 2). Speciﬁcally, PO
and PFM increased the abundance of Schizothecium (P = 0.001) and
Chaetomium (P < 0.001) than PP, with PFM increasing Schizothecium
to a greater degree, and PO increasing Chaetomium to a greater
degree. Conversely, rotation cropping (PO and PFM) decreased
the abundance of potentially phytopathogenic fungi than PP
(Table 2). Speciﬁcally, the relative abundances of Verticillium dahliae
(P = 0.009), Alternaria (P = 0.004), Fusarium (P = 0.007), Gibberella
(P = 0.002), Plectosphaerella (P < 0.001), Phoma (P < 0.001), Lectera
(P < 0.001), and Colletotrichum (P = 0.019) were signiﬁcantly higher
in PP than in PO and PFM but were insigniﬁcantly higher in PO and
PFM.

3.3. Co-occurrence network patterns and
keystone taxa analysis of soil microbial
community
In the present study, the interactions and diﬀerences of soil
bacterial and fungal communities among diﬀerent cropping systems
were investigated at the genus level through co-occurrence networks
(Figure 4), and the resulting complex pattern of the associations
between nodes was depicted via calculating the topological properties
(Supplementary Table 2). Signiﬁcant diﬀerences in topological
properties within bacterial and fungal networks were observed
among the diﬀerent cropping systems. For the bacterial community,
the edges number, network density, modularity, and average
clustering coeﬃcient increased in PO and PFM than PP. The average
path length decreased in PO and PFM than in PP. For the fungal
community, compared with PP, the number of edges was increased in

PFM and decreased in PO. The PO and PFM increased the network
density while decreasing the modularity and average clustering
coeﬃcient than PP.
To determine keystone taxa in the networks, the connectivity
of genera (nodes) was computed within (Zi) and among (Pi)
modules. In this study, most genera were connectors with more
links to the nodes within modules (Figure 5). Compared with PP,
rotation cropping engaged more generalists, which connect diﬀerent
nodes within their modules. In the bacterial networks, 75.77%
of genera for the PP network, 95.65% for the PO network, and
89.69% for the PFM network had connections with other nodes
within and among modules (Supplementary Table 3). In the fungal
networks, 93.58% of genera for the PP network, 95.16% for the
PO network, and 95.24% for the PFM network had links to other
nodes within and among modules (Supplementary Table 3). Crop
rotation altered the keystone taxa in comparison with PP. Nodes,
such as Nitrospira.1, Lysinibacillus, Microlunatus.1, Sphingomonas.3,
Bryobacter.1 and Micromonospora, and Schizothecium were classiﬁed
as network connectors (generalists) within crop rotation but
peripherals (specialists) in PP (Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 4).
In addition, one node (Cystoﬁlobasidium) was classiﬁed as a network
hub (supergeneralist) in the PFM network, whereas there were
no nodes as supergeneralists in the PP network (Figure 5B and
Supplementary Table 4).
Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient examined the relationships
between the relative abundance of keystone taxa and soil properties
(Supplementary Table 5). Nitrospira1 and Sphingomonas3 were
signiﬁcantly related to TN, while Bryobacter1 and Cystoﬁlobasidium
were closely correlated to C/N, and Schizothecium1 was signiﬁcantly
associated with pH, TN, TP, and AP.
3.4. Direct and indirect effects of soil
biotic and abiotic factors on soil
ecosystem multifunctionality
The relationships between soil biotic, abiotic factors, and
soil ecosystem multifunctionality are shown in Supplementary
Table 6. The soil ecosystem multifunctionality was strongly positively
associated with pH (r = 0.64, P < 0.05), TN (r = 0.54, P < 0.05),
AN (r = 0.62, P < 0.05), NAG (r = 0.66, P < 0.01), SOM (r = 0.68,
P < 0.01), β-GC (r = 0.57, P < 0.05), Chaetomiun (r = 0.56,
P < 0.05), Schizothecium1 (r = 0.53, P < 0.05), N cycle (r = 0.87,
P < 0.01), and C cycle (r = 0.80, P < 0.01). The structural
equation modeling (SEM) also estimated the association between
cropping systems, soil chemical properties, microbes abundance
(keystone taxa and potentially phytopathogenic microbes), and
soil ecosystem multifunctionality (Figure 6 and Supplementary
Table 7). The results indicated that the cropping systems had
signiﬁcant and direct positive eﬀects on soil pH (r = 0.79,
P < 0.001) and SOM (r = 0.58, P < 0.01), and signiﬁcant and
negative eﬀects on potentially phytopathogenic microbes (r = –0.85,
P < 0.001). However, the cropping systems had no direct eﬀects
on the keystone taxa and soil ecosystem multifunctionality. We
observed that the pH (r = 0.78, P < 0.001) aﬀected the keystone
taxa abundance directly. Also, SOC (r = 0.66, P < 0.001) and
keystone taxa abundance (r = 0.49, P < 0.001) were positively and
closely linked with soil ecosystem multifunctionality, whereas the
abundance of potentially phytopathogenic microbes was negatively
associated with soil ecosystem multifunctionality (r = –0.16,
P = 0.118).
4. Discussion
4.1. Effect of crop rotation on soil
chemical properties and multifunctionality
The long-term continuous monocropping of crops such as
potatoes, and soybean can cause severe soil degradation and nutrient
imbalance (Liu et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2022). In the current
research, as the years of potato continuous cropping increased, soil
pH noticeably decreased due to the accumulation of phenolic acids
that were beyond the processing capacity of soil microbes (Li et al.,
2016; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, the composition of phenolic
acids in root exudates or rhizosphere soils diﬀered among diﬀerent
rotation crops (Zhou and Wu, 2018), this may be a possible reason
leading to the pH diﬀerence between PO and PFM. SOM and TN
remarkably increased in PO soil likely resulted due to larger root
systems returning more residues to the soil in potato–oat rotation
cropping system than in potato continuous cropping. Moreover, the
nutrient uptake of diﬀerent rotation crops and their utilization ability
signiﬁcantly diﬀered. Plants with greater aboveground biomass often
require more nutrients for growth than smaller plants. This may be
a possible reason leading to the SOM and TN being higher in PO
than that in PFM. Wu et al. (2021b) reported that the SOM and TN
were higher in the wheat season (SOM 27.94∼30.31 g kg−1 and TN
0.92∼1.16 g kg−1) than that in the maize season (SOM 20.00∼24.26 g
kg−1 and TN 0.89∼1.03 g kg−1). Conversely, the results of soil TP
and AP were remarkably lower in crop rotation systems than that in
continuous cropping of potatoes. The reason for this result may be
due to diﬀerent requirements of phosphorus among diﬀerent crops
and that the phosphorus requirement in maize and oats is greater
than in potatoes.
4.2. Effect of crop rotation on soil
microbial community composition
The microbial community structure was markedly aﬀected
by rotation cropping based on the PCoA. We found that the
communities of bacteria and fungi were predominantly subdivided
into two groups, and PP varied from those of PO and PFM. The result
indicates that rotation cropping is a major reason for determining
the changes in bacterial and fungal community composition (Liu
et al., 2020). This is possibly attributed to crop root exudates and
residual accumulation diﬀerences in a soil environment with diﬀerent
cropping systems because crop root exudates and residues can
impact the structure of microbial communities by providing diﬀerent
nutritional substances for microbes. In addition, communities in
the soil of the PO and PFM clustered together for bacteria but
were separated by the PC2 axis for fungi. This result indicated that
diﬀerent rotation crops aﬀected the fungal community structures.
Rotation cropping changed the dominant microbes in comparison
with potato continuous cropping. LEfSe analysis suggested that
the variation in the bacterial community structure was mainly
driven by 26 taxa, among which Cyanobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes,
and Bacilli performed a major role in PP, PO, and PFM,

respectively. Gemmatimonadetes are copiotrophic populations and
prefer decomposing labile organic carbon fractions with rich

obtained higher abundance in PO soil with greater TN and SOM. In

of Bacilli showed a signiﬁcant and positive association with C/N

(Supplementary Table 5). In addition, the abundance of Bacillus and
Pseudomonas increased in PFM than PP and PO, and some species
within Bacillus and Pseudomonas are antagonistic strains to plant
pathogens, allowing potato and banana to suppress common scab and
fusarium wilt disease (Lin et al., 2018; Tao et al., 2020). Li et al. (2022)
documented that, compared with peanut continuous cropping, rape–
peanut–winter wheat–summer maize rotation increased Bacillus
abundance, which has biological control activities. However, the
pathogenic bacteria Streptomyces scabiei, which causes potato scab
diseases, was slightly decreased in PFM than PP and PO. This result
may be associated with the increased abundance of potential plant-
beneﬁcial bacteria, which inhibit the growth and sporulation of
Streptomyces scabiei within PFM. Previous studies reported that both
Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens can inhibit
the growth of Streptomyces scabiei and reduce the occurrence of
potato common scab in potato production (Arseneault et al., 2015;
Lin et al., 2018).
With
regards
to
fungi,
Nectriaceae,
Chaetomium,
and
Basidiomycota, as the main dominant taxa, performed major
roles in PP, PO, and PFM, respectively. Nectriaceae contain
pathogens that cause the rotting of plant roots (Toju et al., 2018).
Species of Chaetomium are important agents of cellulose degradation
(Wu et al., 2021a); the degradation of oat residues may lead to a
higher abundance of Chaetomium. Basidiomycota contains many
saprotrophic soil fungi that are involved in aerobic cellulose
degradation (Boer et al., 2005), which may improve soil fertility. In
addition, the abundance of Schizothecium was signiﬁcantly higher
in PFM than that in PP and PO, Chaetomium was signiﬁcantly
higher in PO than that in PP and PFM, and these genera can protect
crops and vegetables from diseases (Zhao et al., 2013; Nong et al.,
2017). There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in soil environment among
diﬀerent cropping ecosystems. This could be a reason to explain
the fungal community composition diﬀerences among diﬀerent
cropping ecosystems. Soil pH and nutrients are important factors
aﬀecting fungal community composition (Wang et al., 2022). In
this study, the abundance of Chaetomium, Schizothecium, and
Basidiomycota showed signiﬁcant and positive associations with pH
and TN, respectively, while signiﬁcant negative correlations between
the abundance of Nectriaceae and pH and TN were observed
(Supplementary Table 5). Other studies demonstrated that the
diﬀerence in the fungal community composition among diﬀerent
treatments is also caused by the root exudates (e.g., sugars, organic
acids, aromatics, and enzymes) of the rotation crops (Lang et al.,
2019). Conversely, the abundance of potentially phytopathogenic
fungi was signiﬁcantly enriched in PP. Alternaria is a potentially
phytopathogenic fungus that causes potato early blight disease,
potato brown spot, and soybean black spot, and was signiﬁcantly
richer in PP compared with that in PO and PFM (Wang et al., 2022;
Xu et al., 2022). Fusarium can infect a wide variety of crops and lead
to corresponding diseases, such as potato dry rot disease and potato
fusarium wilt (Zhang et al., 2017), which was higher in PP than that
in PO and PFM. Verticillium dahliae can cause verticillium wilt in
the potato during growth (Zhao et al., 2021) and was enriched in PP
than PO and PFM.

These results suggested that continuous potato cropping
promotes the growth and proliferation of speciﬁc pathogenic
microbes in the soil, enhances disease infection risk, and disturbs
the balance of the microbial community structure, while the rotation
cropping of potato and oat (PO) and potato and forage maize
(PFM) reduced potentially phytopathogenic microbes but increased
potential plant-beneﬁcial microbes. This may be the major reason
that rotation cropping increased the yield and decreased the diseases
of potatoes than continuous cropping of potatoes (Yao et al., 2020).
Variations of soil microbial community composition in response to
diﬀerent cropping systems also revealed that rotation cropping in
comparison with continuous cropping of potatoes can maintain soil
ecosystem health.
4.3. Effect of crop rotation on
co-occurrence network patterns and
keystone taxa
Core microbes may represent coevolution with plants, which
may be signiﬁcant for plant health and productivity (Cúcio et al.,
2016). In the current study, we further explored the interactions and
diﬀerences in both bacterial and fungal co-occurrence patterns under
diﬀerent cropping systems by analyzing co-occurrence networks.
Network topological properties displayed obvious distinctions in
both bacterial and fungal co-occurrence patterns among PP, PO,
and PFM. The number of edges for bacterial communities in
rotation cropping soils was dramatically greater than those in potato
continuous cropping soils. This ﬁnding is in line with Liu et al. (2020),
who reported that the number of edges increased in the network
of maize–soybean rotation than soybean continuous cropping. This
result indicated that rotation cropping exhibits a larger network size
and recruits more microbes participating in the bacteria–bacteria
interactions than those in potato continuous cropping (Karimi et al.,
2019). The PO and PFM microbial networks had larger network
densities and lower average path lengths than the network of PP. This
indicated that, compared with potato continuous cropping, rotation
cropping enhanced the bacteria–bacteria interactions in terms of
exchanges of nutrients, information, and energy among diﬀerent
communities (Chen et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2021). In addition, the
average clustering coeﬃcient and modularity were greater in PO and
PFM networks than that in the PP network, indicating that bacteria
in rotation cropping soils are more sensitive to the disturbance
of external environmental factors and respond more rapidly, and
community structure is more prone to change (de Araujo et al.,
2019). These ﬁndings are in line with Chen et al. (2018), who
reported that there were higher connectivity and clustering coeﬃcient
in the tobacco–corn rotation network than in tobacco continuous
cropping. For the fungal community, changes in the number of edges
and network density as well as average path length were consistent
with alterations in the bacterial communities. However, the average
clustering coeﬃcient and modularity showed contrary changes in the
bacterial community. This may be primarily attributed to the slow
responses of soil fungi to external environmental change and may
have less inﬂuence on the whole ecological network of fungi within
brief periods (Wu et al., 2021a).
Rotation cropping altered the keystone taxa in both bacterial
and fungal co-occurrence networks, which play important roles in
the structure of the microbial community. In networks, generalists
are beneﬁcial for sustaining the microbial community balance and
Frontiers in Microbiology

are emerging as essential players in enhancing the exchanges of
information, materials, and energy among species in networks (Chen
et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2021). For bacterial networks, the Zi–Pi
relationship of every individual genus demonstrated that 95.65 and
89.69% of generalists existed in the networks of PO and PFM,
respectively. However, in the PP network, the relative abundance
of generalists decreased to 75.77% (74.74% connectors and 1.03%
module hubs). For fungal networks, generalists that existed in the
networks of PO and PFM were 95.16 and 95.24%, respectively. In
addition, 1.19% of supergeneralists existed in the PFM network,
whereas the relative abundance of generalists decreased to 93.58% in
the PP network. Chen et al. (2018) reported that there were more
generalists in the tobacco–corn rotation network than in tobacco
continuous cropping. Yang et al. (2021) found that the number
of connectors increased under pulse frequency (e.g., pea–pea–pea–
wheat) than low-pulse frequency (e.g., pea–wheat–wheat–wheat) in
crop rotations. The higher number of generalists under rotation
cropping networks indicated that soil microbes were more active
within their own modules under continuous cropping, but tended
to establish connections with genera located at diﬀerent modules
under crop rotation. These results revealed that rotation cropping
enhanced the interactions of soil microbes and altered the roles of
some nodes and modiﬁed the ecological functions of key microbes
in soils in comparison with potato continuous cropping. Thus,
the reduction in the number of generalists and supergeneralists
after potato continuous cropping could be perceived as a major
reason causing the problems associated with continuous cropping in
potatoes.

of
keystone
taxa
(Supplementary Table 4). Speciﬁcally, Nitrospira.1 was the node
with a maximum degree and was determined as a generalist in the
PO and PFM networks, but was determined as a specialist in the
PP network. Nitrospira plays an important role in nitrogen cycling
(Daims et al., 2015; Ochieno et al., 2021). In this study, Nitrospira.1
was positively associated with TN (Supplementary Table 5).
Some nodes that were identiﬁed as generalists [Lysinibacillus
(Firmicutes), Microlunatus.1 (Actinobacteriota), and Sphingomonas.3
(Proteobacteria)] in the PO and PFM networks but as specialists
in the PP network play key roles in the degradation of pesticide
and organic pollutants (Li et al., 2007, 2018). Species of Firmicutes
and Actinobacteriota could produce antibacterial and nematocidal
compounds to prevent some soil-borne diseases, such as soybean
root rot and potato scab (Qi et al., 2010; Sugiyama et al., 2014; Shi
et al., 2019). Phyla Proteobacteria is a copiotrophic population and
prefer decomposing labile organic C fractions with rich nutrients
(Ghosh et al., 2016; Clocchiatti et al., 2020). Previous studies
demonstrated that the phylum Actinobacteriota was the most
important keystone member in potato soils (Gu et al., 2022). Chen
et al. (2018) reported that microbes belonging to Firmicutes and
Proteobacteria were enriched in the tobacco–corn rotation network.
Oberholster et al. (2018) found that members of the Proteobacteria
are the most prominent keystone taxa in the sunﬂower–sorghum
rotation networks. In this study, Sphingomonas.3 belonging to
Proteobacteria was positively associated with TN (Supplementary
Table 5). Bryobacter.1 was the node with a maximum degree and
was classiﬁed as a generalist in the PO network, but was classiﬁed
as a specialist in the PP network. Liu et al. (2020) reported that
Bryobacter aggregates, which have the ability to decompose organic
matter in the soil, were classiﬁed as keystone taxa in maize–soybean
rotation. In this study, Bryobacter.1 was positively associated with
C/N (Supplementary Table 5). Micromonospora (Actinobacteriota)
and Schizothecium (Ascomycota) were the nodes with maximum
degrees and were classiﬁed as generalists in the PFM network, but
were classiﬁed as specialists in the PP network. In addition, one node
[Cystoﬁlobasidium (Basidiomycota)] was classiﬁed as a network hub
(supergeneralist) in the PFM network, whereas was not classiﬁed as
a supergeneralist in the PP network. All those genera are considered
beneﬁcial microbes and have been used to control crop diseases in
agricultural production (Hirsch and Valdés, 2010; Garat et al., 2010;
Liu et al., 2020). This result is contrary to a previous study, which
reported that Actinobacteriota, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota were
the most important keystone taxa in soils with potatoes cropping
(Hou et al., 2020). This may be related to the diﬀerence in soil
environment and nutrient resources. Correlation analysis indicated
that signiﬁcant positive associations occur among Schizothecium1,
pH, and TN (Supplementary Table 5), and negative correlations
among Schizothecium1, TP, AP (Supplementary Table 5), Alternaria,
and other potentially phytopathogenic fungi (Supplementary
Table 8). In addition, keystone taxa Cystoﬁlobasidium exhibited
a
signiﬁcantly
negative
correlation
with
Streptomyces
scabiei
(Supplementary Table 8). Therefore, these keystone functional taxa
in PO and PFM may be beneﬁcial for improving soil ecosystem
environments and enhancing soil disease-suppression ability after
long-term rotation cropping in comparison with continuous
cropping of potatoes.
4.4. Factors mediating soil ecosystem
multifunctionality under cropping systems
Soil chemical properties not only aﬀected microbial community
compositions but also the soil ecosystem multifunctionality. In
this study, soil ecosystem multifunctionality was increased in crop
rotation than PP, mainly driven by pH, TN, AN, SOM, N cycle, and
C cycle. This indicates that higher carbon and nitrogen resource
availability favors the growth of microbes, eventually promotes
biogeochemical cycles, and enhances ecological functions (Geyer
et al., 2016; Han et al., 2021). Also, soil biotic factors aﬀect soil
ecosystem multifunctionality. A previous study has demonstrated
that microbes play critical roles in supporting ecosystem functioning
(Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2016). In this study, positive links
among keystone taxa, potential plant-beneﬁcial microbes, and soil
ecosystem multifunctionality are conspicuous. Schizothecium1 and
Chaetomium were positively related to C and N cycling as well
as soil ecosystem multifunctionality (Supplementary Table 6), and
the potential phytopathogenic microbes were negatively associated
with C and N cycling as well as soil ecosystem multifunctionality
(Supplementary Table 6). SEM also suggested that pH and SOC were
abiotic factors aﬀecting soil ecosystem multifunctionality (Figure 6),
and that pH indirectly aﬀected soil ecosystem multifunctionality by
mediating keystone taxa, and SOC directly aﬀected soil ecosystem
multifunctionality. Soil pH decreased with the increasing years of
continuous cropping (Li et al., 2016), which is an important factor
signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing soil microbial community composition
(Wang et al., 2019), and subsequently aﬀecting soil ecosystem
multifunctionality. Rotation crop residues are a source of organic
carbon and can increase organic carbon input (Rao et al., 2021),
and then promote soil biochemistry processes and ecosystem
multifunctionality (Ma et al., 2022).

5. Conclusion
Our experimental ﬁndings demonstrated that rotation cropping
(PO and PFM) altered soil ecosystem multifunctionality, chemical
properties, microbial community compositions, and keystone taxa in
comparison with potato continuous cropping. In addition, compared
with potato continuous cropping, rotation cropping increased the
abundance of potential plant-beneﬁcial bacteria and fungi but
reduced potentially phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi, indicating
that rotation cropping causes a more healthy microﬂora, and is
beneﬁcial to soil health and sustainable use of soil. Furthermore,
co-occurrence networks of bacteria within rotation cropping (PO
and PFM) and co-occurrence networks of fungi within PFM were
more complex than potato continuous cropping. Keystone taxa were
related to bacterial and fungal functional groups that may play
underlying roles in the nutrient cycling, toxic material degradation,
and prevention and control of soil-borne disease, suggesting that
these keystone taxa may play vital roles in improving the soil
environment and ecosystem multifunctionality and may make it
possible to develop disease-suppressive soils in rotation cropping
systems. Collectively, rotation cropping is an eﬀective practice to
improve soil ecosystem multifunctionality in agroecosystems and
relieve continuous cropping obstacles in comparison with potato
continuous cropping, and this study provides a scientiﬁc basis for the
selection of rotation crops in potato continuous cropping.
