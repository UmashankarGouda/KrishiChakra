In the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (EIGP), conventional rice-wheat system has led to a decline in productivity, 
input-use efficiency, and profitability. To address these, a four-year field study was conducted to evaluate the 
performance of tillage and crop establishment (TCE) methods in rice-wheat-greengram rotation. The treatments 
included: 1) random puddled transplanted rice (RPTR) - conventional-till broadcast wheat (BCW) - zero-till 
greengram (ZTG); 2) line PTR (LPTR) - conventional-till drill sown wheat (CTW) - ZTG; 3) machine trans­
planted rice in puddled soil (CTMTR) - zero tillage wheat (ZTW) - ZTG; 4) machine transplanted rice in zero-till 
wet soil (ZTMTR) - ZTW - ZTG; 5) system of rice intensification (SRI) - system of wheat intensification (SWI) - 
ZTG; 6) direct-seeded rice (DSR) - ZTW - ZTG; and 7) zero-till DSR - ZTW - ZTG. During the initial two years, 
conventional rice system (PTR) recorded a 16.2 % higher rice grain yield than DSR system. Whereas in the fourth 
year, the rice yields under DSR and PTR were comparable. As compared to SRI/SWI, the average wheat yield in 
ZT system was significantly high, whereas in rice, SRI/SWI system was comparable with CT system. ZTW after 
non-puddled rice was at par to CTW after PTR. The ZT wheat produced 4.6 % more yield than CT system. DSR 
production system consumed 6.8 % less water compared to transplanted system. On the system basis, 10.8 % 
higher net returns were recorded with CA-based system compared to conventional system. The system energy 
productivity under CA-based production system was 14–36 % higher than PTR-based systems. CA-based system 
also led to 8–10 % lower global warming potential (GWP) than conventional methods. The current study indi­
cated that as compared to conventional system, a significant gain in productivity, profitability and energy-use 
efficiency, and reduction in the environmental mitigation are possible with emerging alternative TCE 
methods. Long-term expansion and further refinement of these technologies in local areas need to be explored for 
the second green revolution.   
1. Introduction 
Rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS) is the largest agricultural pro­
duction system, extended over nearly 14 million ha in the Indo-Gangetic 
Plains (IGP) of South Asia (Alam et al., 2016). Although RWCS is vital for 
ensuring future food security and livelihood of millions of people in 
South Asia (Kumar et al., 2018), the path to success has been affected by 
declining soil health (Mondal et al., 2020), groundwater resources 
(Bhatt et al., 2016), monocropping of cereal-cereal system, increasing 
climate variabilities (Jain et al., 2014), and changing socio-economic 
dynamics (Dubey et al., 2020). 
The EIGP has the majority (~90 %) of marginal farmers, and the per

capita income of INR 62,631 (US$ 835) per household per annum is 
much lower than the national (India) average of INR 94,130 (US$ 1256) 
(Mishra et al., 2020). Rice-wheat-summer fallow production system is 
extensively practiced by the farmers of this region. In this system, rice is 
conventionally grown by manual transplanting of 25–30 days old 
seedlings into puddled soil during wet season (June to October), and 
requires a large amount of water. The process of puddling requires 
~200−250 mm water (Rashid et al., 2018), and it is both labour and 
energy-intensive (Islam et al., 2020). Besides, the beneficial effects of 
soil puddling on rice through improved water retention, better weed 
control, quick seedling establishment and improved nutrient availability 
(Islam et al., 2020), it also deteriorates the physico-chemical (Mondal 
et al., 2019) and biological properties of the soil, and adversely affects 
crop growth and productivity of post-rice crops (Kumar et al., 2018). In 
the subsequent winter season (November-March) wheat is grown with 
repeated dry tillage by broadcasting wheat seeds and mixing the seed at 
the shallow depth by one or two passes of rotavator, resulting in poor 
crop establishment and lower yields (Paudel et al., 2020). After wheat 
harvest, fields remain fallow during the summer for a period of 75–80 
days (April-June), and summer ploughing to destroy the insect pests and 
weeds, is a common practice by most of the farmers during fallow 
period. 
In order to ensure the food security of the nation, eastern India has 
been targeted for ushering second Green Revolution. At present in 
RWCS, most of the rice area in EIGP is covered by long-duration 
(150–160 days) paddy varieties coupled with late transplanting. Late 
harvesting of rice, and longer turnaround period results in delayed 
wheat sowing with lower yield and quality due to terminal heat stress 
during grain filling (Jain et al., 2017). Tripathi et al. (2005) also re­
ported an average yield loss of 27 kg ha−1 day−1 with delay in wheat 
planting beyond November 15. With increased use of combined ma­
chines for harvesting rice and wheat in the region, large amount of crop 
residue is left in the fields. According to one estimate, RWCS alone 
contributes ~33 % of the total crop residue (~ 620 million tons) 
generated every year in the Indian IGP (Raghuveer-Singh et al., 2019). 
Management of the loose and scattered rice residue after combined 
harvest is a major challenge as it obstructs the tillage operations and 
seeding of succeeding wheat crop (Sidhu et al., 2007). In order to clean 
the fields for sowing of wheat after rice, further greengram after wheat 
harvest, local farmers quickly burn the left-over rice/wheat residue, 
which is becoming a common inexpensive phenomenon in EIGP (Jain 
et al., 2014). It has been estimated that burning of one ton of rice residue 
accounts for a loss of 5.5 kg N, 2.3 kg P, 25 kg K and 1.2 kg S besides, 
organic carbon (NPMCR, 2014). Crop residue burning results in envi­
ronmental pollution including greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, loss of 
earthworms/microbial population, lowering of soil nutrients and 
organic humus content in the top soil, which in long run reduces the soil 
fertility and sustainability (Singh et al., 2020b). Stopping crop residue 
burning will not only counteract the GHG emission (6266 Gg yr−1) but 
can also improve soil health when incorporated into the soil (Benbi, 
2018). 
Conservation Agriculture (CA)-based management paradigm (i.e., 
minimal soil movement, retaining crop residue cover on soil surface, and 
use of diversified crop rotation) adopted by the farmers in South Asia 
(Mishra et al., 2020) has prompted scientists to revisit and provide so­
lutions to many emerging challenges (Ranaivoson et al., 2017). The CA 
practices and cropping systems followed elsewhere are diverse than 
those adopted in the EIGP. While puddling and transplanting are pop­
ular in rice, ZT with or without crop residue retention is practiced in 
succeeding winter crops indicating that the protocols of CA are partially 
adopted in the EIGP. 
The beneficial effects of CA are largely attributed to the permanent 
crop residue cover on the soil surface (Ranaivoson et al., 2017). The 
positive effects of crop residue depend upon its quantity, quality, and 
placement. The adoption of CA not only provides extra inputs of nutri­
ents but also prevents its loss from local ecosystem (Alves et al., 2010). 
New facts about gradual N-release from legume residue are even more 
compelling (Alves et al., 2010). The efficiency of a zero-tillage produc­
tion system depends on the amount and distribution of plant residue left 
on soil surface (Samal et al., 2017). Zero tillage with residue retention 
offers a yield advantage of 5.8 %, improved water use efficiency by 12.6 
%, an increase in net income of 25.9 %, and a reduction of 12.33 % in 
global warming potential (Jat et al., 2020). Despite several benefits, 
there is a slow adoption rate of ZT in the EIGP because of the limited 
access to required inputs (seeding machinery, herbicides, etc.), and old 
mindset of farmers (Keil et al., 2015; Lal, 2007). 
The vulnerability of smallholder subsistence farmers (Thierfelder 
and Mupangwa, 2014) to global climate change (Wassmann et al., 2009) 
is expected more with rice yields projected to reduce about 3.2–22 % 
with an increase in air temperature (1−4 ◦C) by the end of this century 
as per simulated model (Zhao et al., 2017). It has been estimated that 
climate change may likely reduce the rice-wheat system productivity by 
about 4 % under farmers’ practice across eastern IGP (Tesfaye et al., 
2019). As the average temperature in this region rises, early sowing of 
wheat using resource conservation technologies (RCTs) will become 
even more important (Dubey et al., 2020). It is not enough to increase 
the yield of RWCS, a third crop must be offered to the smallholders of 
EIGP for achieving a 300 % cropping intensity. The time saving through 
CA-based interventions will facilitate early wheat sowing and the timely 
sowing of greengram in succession. Inclusion of grain legumes into crop 
sequences helps in the accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen (Borase 
et al., 2020), and reduces soil CO2 emission (de Araújo Santos et al., 
2019d) under ZT production system. Diversification of rice-wheat 
cropping system with greengram would not only improve the soil 
health and farm income, but also reduce the water use and increase the 
adaptability to heat and water stress (Pathak, 2010). 
New facts and crop establishment (CE) methods may shift the eco­
nomic fundamentals in favour of sustainable intensification of RWCS. 
Some CE methods including zero-tillage with crop residue retention on 
the soil surface, mechanical rice transplanting, system of rice intensifi­
cation (SRI), and DSR have their strengths and weaknesses (Jat et al., 
2019b). Considering all these, triple zero-till cropping (ZT DSR-ZT 
wheat-ZT greengram) under the irrigated agro-ecosystem of EIGP may 
emerge as more sustainable RWCS for smallholder farmers. 
Most of the studies in EIGP were conducted on zero-tillage based on a 
single crop in rice-wheat production system. Hence, the present study 
was focused to identify the suitable tillage and crop establishment 
practice to improve the productivity and profitability of rice-wheat- 
greengram system. In addition, some important CA-based parameters 
like energy use, and how efficient use of energy can help to reduce the 
environmental footprints. We hypothesized that CA-based tillage and 
crop establishment methods would improve crop yields, water produc­
tivity, net income, and energy efficiency; and reduce the environmental 
footprint. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Experimental site and soil 
The field experiments were carried out at the research farm (25◦35’ 
N, 85◦05’ E, and 51 m above mean sea level) of ICAR Research Complex 
for Eastern Region, Patna, Bihar, India (Suppl. Fig. 1) during 
2015–2019. The study continued for 48 months, where rice was grown 
during wet season (June-October), and wheat (November-March) and 
greengram (April-June) during dry seasons. The climate of the region is 
sub-tropical hot and humid, with an average annual rainfall of 1167 mm 
(70–75 % of which is received during July to September months), 
minimum temperature of 7.4–10.4 ◦C in January and maximum tem­
perature of 35.1–39.6 ◦C in May. The annual mean humidity of the re­
gion was 67.2 %, being highest (80.5 %) and lowest (50.0 %) during 
September and April, respectively. Mean monthly temperature and 
monthly rainfall during the study period (2015−16 to 2018−19) are

depicted in Fig. 1. The soil at the study site had a silty loam (Vertic 
Endoaqualfs) texture in the 0−15 cm surface layer with pH 7.22 and 
electrical conductivity (EC) of 0.17 dS m−1. The soil physical and 
chemical properties at the beginning of the experiment are presented in 
Suppl. Table 1. 
2.2. Treatment details and experimental design 
The experiment was initiated in June 2015 with rice crop after the 
harvest of wheat. The entire experimental area was laser-levelled in May 
2015 before the start of the experiment. Seven combinations of tillage 
and crop establishment methods (TCE) for a rice-wheat-greengram 
cropping system were evaluated in a randomized complete block 
design with three replications. Each plot measured 8.1m × 20m. The 
seven TCE treatments were: 1) puddled random transplanted rice 
(RPTR) - conventional till (CT) broadcast wheat (BCW) - zero-till 
greengram (ZTG); 2) puddled line transplanted rice (LPTR) - CT dril­
led wheat (CTW) - ZTG; 3) puddled machine transplanted rice (CTMTR) 
- zero-till wheat (ZTW) - ZTG; 4) zero-till machine transplanted rice 
(ZTMTR) - ZTW - ZTG; 5) system of rice intensification (SRI) - system of 
wheat intensification (SWI) - ZTG; 6) CT direct-seeded rice (CTDSR) - 
ZTW - ZTG; and 7) zero-till DSR (ZTDSR) - ZTW - ZTG. Treatment no­
tations and details of the management practices are presented in Table 1. 
2.3. Crop management 
2.3.1. Rice 
Irrespective of the treatments, a medium-duration (135 days) hybrid 
rice ‘Arize 6444 Gold’ purchased from local market, was used 
throughout the study period. Direct-seeded rice (DSR) was drilled in 
rows at 22.5 cm apart during 3rd week of June every year using Zero-till 
Happy Seeder having an inclined-plate seed metering system (Dasmesh, 
Malerkotla, Sangrur, Punjab, India) at a seed rate of 25 kg ha−1. The 
seeding depth of 3−4 cm was maintained for all DSR (ZT/CT) treatments 
using a depth control system of the seeder. Nurseries for PTR, MTR and 
SRI were sown on the same day of DSR seeding, with the recommended 
package of practice (Singh et al., 2020a). For MTR, a mat-type nursery 
was raised using a seed rate of 20 kg ha−1. A mixture (4:1) of fine sieved 
soil and farmyard manure (FYM) was prepared and spread on a poly­
thene sheet with a thickness of 1.5–2.0 cm on raised beds (Singh et al., 
2020a). The moisture was maintained initially by regular spraying of 
water, and later by light irrigations. The polythene sheet acted as a 
barrier between rice seedlings roots and underlying soil, and does not 
allow the roots of rice seedlings to penetrate the below soil. Hence, a 
dense mat of roots is formed on the sheet that can easily be uprooted for 
mechanical transplanting (Singh et al., 2020a). For PTR and SRI, 
non-mat nurseries were prepared with a seed rate of 15 and 7 kg ha−1, 
respectively. In SRI, 12-day-old seedlings were uprooted from nursery 
and transplanted manually with single seedling at 25 × 25 cm spacing 
within 30 min of uprooting. For PTR, 25-day-old seedlings were trans­
planted manually in puddle field at 20 × 15 cm spacing with 2−3 
seedlings hill−1, whereas for MTR 18-day-old seedlings were trans­
planted with an 8-row self-riding type paddy transplanter (VST Pvt Ltd, 
Bengaluru, Karnataka, India) at 23 × 14 cm spacing (Singh et al., 
2020a). The details of tillage and crop establishment operations adopted 
are given in Table 1. 
The rice crop was fertilized with 120 kg N as urea and di-ammonium 
phosphate (DAP), 60 kg P2O5 as DAP, 60 kg K2O as muriate of potash 
(MOP) and 25 kg ZnSO4 per hectare (Jat et al., 2014). Full dose of 
phosphorus, potash, ZnSO4 and 1/3 rd of nitrogen (minus N applied as 
DAP) was applied at the time of sowing/transplanting. For transplanted 
rice (PTR/MTR/SRI), basal dose of fertilizers was applied at final 
puddling just before transplanting. For DSR, these were drilled at the 
time of sowing using Zero-till Happy Seeder. Remaining 2/3 rd of ni­
trogen was applied in two equal splits at mid tillering and panicle 
initiation stages of crop (Kumar et al., 2017). 
To manage the existing weeds (grassy, broad-leaved and sedges) in 
ZT plots (ZTDSR/ ZTMTR), glyphosate at 1.0 kg a.i. ha−1 was applied 
one week before sowing/transplanting. In DSR, pendimethalin 1.0 kg a. 
i. ha−1 as pre-emergence at one day after seeding (DAS), and bispyribac-

sodium at 25 g a.i. ha−1 at 20−25 DAS were applied to manage the 
weeds. In PTR and MTR, pretilachlor at 0.75 kg a.i. ha−1 was applied at 
2−3 days after transplanting (DAT) followed by bispyribac-sodium at 25 
g a.i. ha−1 at 20−25 DAT (Singh et al., 2020a). Herbicides were applied 
with 500 L ha−1 of water by using a knapsack sprayer fitted with flat-fan 
nozzle. Additionally, one hand weeding was also done to remove any 
escaped weeds. In SRI, weeds were managed by using a cono-weeder 
twice at 15–20 DAT and 30–35 DAT. No major incidence of 
insect-pest and diseases was observed in rice. 
All DSR plots (ZT/CT) were sown after receipt of pre-monsoon rains 
and when there was sufficient soil moisture for germination. Subsequent 
irrigations were given when dry-spells exceeded more than one week 
and appearance of hairline soil cracks. In the event of normal rainfall, no 
irrigation was applied. For transplanted rice (PTR/MTR/SRI), puddling 
was done in flooded field with ~7-cm water using a rotavator. Trans­
planting of rice seedlings was done with ~5-cm standing water followed 
by continuous flooding with ~ 5-cm for the first 8–10 days to facilitate 
proper crop establishment. Subsequent irrigations were applied at 
disappearance of flood water and appearance of hairline soil cracks as 
per the criterion of alternate wetting and drying (AWD) (Gathala et al., 
2013). All the plots (DSR and transplanted) were irrigated at the same 
time 
depending 
on 
rainfall 
events. 
The 
number 
of 
post-sowing/transplanting irrigations varied from 3 to 5 in different 
years depending upon the amount and distribution of rainfall. Irrigation 
was applied through polyvinyl chloride pipes of 10-cm diameter. In each 
irrigation, ~ 5-cm water was applied. The amount of irrigation water 
applied to each plot was measured using a water meter (Dasmesh Water 
Meters, Amritsar, Punjab, India). Rainfall data were recorded using a 
rain-gauge installed in the automatic weather station at the experi­
mental site. The total quantity of water applied was calculated by adding 
up the amount of water applied through irrigation and rainfall (I + R). 
The quantity of irrigation water applied and water productivity were 
computed for each treatment. The source of irrigation water was always 
ground water. The amount of irrigation water applied was quantified, 
and water productivity (WP I+R) was computed as follows (Choudhary 
et al., 2018).  
Volume of irrigation water (kilolitre ha−1) = [(Final water meter reading-Initial 
water meter reading)/Plot area in m2] X 10,000                                    
(1)  
Irrigation water (ha-mm) = Volume of irrigation water (kilolitre ha−1)/10 (2)  
Total water productivity (WP I+R) (kg grain m−3 of water) = Grain yield (kg 
ha-1)/[Irrigation water applied (m3) + rainfall received by crop (m3)] ha-1 (3) 
Where, 1 ha-mm irrigation depth = 10 kilolitre = 10 m3; 1 m3 = 1000 L 
Economic water productivity, defined as the value derived per unit of 
water used, was estimated by multiplying the WP (I + R) values with 
minimum support price (MSP) of respective crops. 
Yield attributes of rice, i.e., panicle length (cm), number of panicles 
m−2, number of grains panicle-1 and 1000-grains weight (g) (at 14 % 
moisture content) were recorded at maturity. The number of panicles 
were counted using 1 m2 quadrate from four places in each plot and 
averaged. Panicle length (cm), number of grains per panicle and 1000- 
grains weight (g) were determined from ten randomly selected pani­
cles in each plot. Matured rice under DSR was harvested during last 
week of October (28–31 October), whereas the TPR was harvested 
around one week later (7–10 November) in each year. A net area of 8 m 
× 2 m (16 m2) from the centre of each plot was harvested for recording 
grain and straw yields. Irrespective of the treatments, crop was har­
vested manually with sickle at ~30 cm height from ground level, and 
threshed manually after proper sun drying. Grain yield was adjusted at 
14 % grain moisture content. 
2.3.2. Wheat 
After harvest of rice, the most popular wheat cultivar ‘HD 2967’ 
procured from Borlaug Institute for South Asia (BISA), Pusa, Bihar, was 
grown throughout the study. Although the DSR was harvested about one 
week earlier to TPR, subsequent wheat was sown during 3rd week of 
November at the same time in all the treatments. Before sowing, CT and 
SWI (System of Wheat Intensification) plots were prepared using the 
conventional tillage practices (Singh et al., 2020a), whereas ZT plots 
were sown without tillage in anchored rice crop residue (Table 1). CT 
and ZT wheat plots were drilled in rows 22.5 cm apart at 100-kg seed 
ha−1 using Happy Seeder having inclined-plate seed metering system. 
CT-broadcast (BCW) was established by manual broadcasting and mix­
ing with rotavator with 20 % higher seed rate (120 kg ha-1). The SWI 
wheat was established manually by dibbling method keeping seed rate 
of 25 kg ha-1. The seeding depth of ~5 cm was maintained for all 
treatments. 
The wheat crop was fertilized with 120 kg N as urea and DAP, 60 kg 
P2O5 as DAP, 60 kg K2O as MOP per hectare (Jat et al., 2019b). Full dose 
of phosphorus and potash and 1/3 of nitrogen (minus N applied as DAP) 
were applied at the time of sowing. For drill seeding (CT/ZT), these were 
applied at the time of sowing using zero-till Happy Seeder, whereas, for

broadcast/ SWI, basal dose of fertilizers was applied at final field 
preparation just before sowing. Remaining 2/3 nitrogen was applied in 
two equal splits at crown root initiation (CRI) and maximum tillering 
stages of crop, which coincided with the first and third irrigations, 
respectively. 
Wheat crop was established with pre-sowing irrigation. Irrigation 
was applied through polyvinyl chloride pipes of 10 cm diameter. In 
addition to pre-sowing irrigation, four irrigations were applied in all the 
plots coinciding with critical growth stages of wheat (CRI, tillering, 
flowering and grain filling stages). In each irrigation, ~ 5 cm water was 
applied. The amount of irrigation water applied to each plot was 
measured using a water meter. In all ZT plots, glyphosate at 1.0 kg a.i. 
ha−1 was applied before sowing to kill the emerged weeds. Additionally, 
ready-mix solution of sulfosulfuron (75 %WG) + metsulfuron methyl (5 
%WG) @ 32 (30 + 2) g a.i. ha−1 was applied as post-emergence (25 days 
after sowing) in all the plots to control annual grasses and broad-leaved 
weeds. Herbicides were applied with 500 L ha−1 of water by using a 
knapsack sprayer fitted with flat-fan nozzle. 
Yield attributes of wheat, i.e., spike length, number of spikes m−2, 
number of grains spike-1 and 1000-grains weight (g) (at 12 % moisture 
content) were recorded at maturity. The number of spikes were counted 
using 1 m2 quadrate from four places in each plot and averaged. Spike 
length, number of grains per spike and 1000-grains weight (g) were 
determined from ten randomly selected spikes in each plot. Wheat was 
harvested during the first week of April each year. A net area of 8 m × 2 
m (16 m2) from the centre of each plot was harvested for recording grain 
and straw yields. Irrespective of the treatments, the crop was harvested 
manually with sickle at ~ 30 cm height from ground level, and threshed 
manually after proper sun drying. Grain yield was adjusted at 12 % grain 
moisture content. 
2.3.3. Greengram 
Short duration (60–65 days) greengram cultivar ‘SML 668’ released 
from Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, Punjab, India was grown 
initially during 2016 which was replaced by ‘Samrat’, released from 
ICAR-Indian Institute of Pulse Research, Kanpur in 2017. Seeds of both 
varieties were purchased from the local market. A pre-sowing irrigation 
was applied immediately after wheat harvest, and seeds were drilled 
without tillage in anchored wheat crop residue during second week of 
April. Sowing was done in rows at 22.5 cm apart at 30-kg seed ha−1 
using Zero-till Happy Seeder having an inclined-plate seed metering 
system. The seeding depth of ~5-cm was maintained for all treatments 
using depth control system of the seeder. In all plots, glyphosate at 1.0 
kg a.i. ha-1 was applied before sowing to kill the emerged weeds. Pen­
dimethalin at 1.0 kg a.i. ha-1 was applied as pre-emergence one day after 
seeding to control subsequent weed emergence. Crop received 18 kg N 
and 46 kg P2O5 ha-1 through DAP. Full dose of nitrogen and phosphorus 
was applied at the time of sowing through Happy Seeder. In addition to 
pre-sowing irrigation, two irrigations (at 25 and 45 DAS) were applied in 
all the plots. Irrigation was applied through polyvinyl chloride pipes of 
10 cm diameter, and in each irrigation ~5 cm water was applied. The 
amount of irrigation water applied to each plot was measured using a 
water meter. Two sprays of triazophos 40 EC @ 2.0 mL l-1 of water were 
done to check the infestation of whitefly (Bemisia spp.) to manage yellow 
mosaic disease infestation. A net area of 8 m × 2 m (16 m2) from the 
centre of each plot was used for grain yield estimation. Grain yield was 
reported at 12 % grain moisture content. After picking its matured pods 
twice (except in 2018, when only one picking could be done due to early 
monsoon rains in June), whole plants were retained, removed and 
ploughed down in ZTDSR, ZTMTR and CTDSR/PTR/SRI treatments, 
respectively. The retained greengram plants were desiccated with spray 
of paraquat (Gramoxone 24 % SL) herbicide at 0.48 kg a.i. ha-1 with 500 
L ha-1 of water before ZTDSR seeding. 
2.4. System productivity 
To compare the productivity of rice-wheat-greengram cropping 
system, the grain yields of wheat and greengram were converted into 
rice equivalent yield (REY t ha−1) and calculated as sum of rice yield and 
REYs of wheat and greengram for each treatment (Mondal et al., 2020).  
REY of wheat = [(Wheat grain yield x MSP of wheat) / (MSP of rice)]   (4)  
REY of greengram = [(Greengram grain yield x MSP of greengram) / (MSP of 
rice)]

System productivity = Rice grain yield + REY of Wheat + REY of Greengram

2.5. Residue management and estimation of crop residue recycled 
All previous crop residue (stubbles left after crop harvest) were 
either retained on the soil surface or incorporated with tillage as per 
treatment except for ZTMTR, where all the greengram residue were 
removed to facilitate machine transplanting. In conventional-till wheat 
plots (CTW, BCW and SWI), ~ 30 % rice residue (20−25 cm long 
stubble) was incorporated, whereas, in zero-till wheat plots, it was 
retained on the soil surface in succeeding wheat crop. In greengram, 
~30 % wheat residue (lower part) was retained in all the treatments. In 
rice, 100 % greengram residue (after picking its matured pods in the 
field) was retained in ZTDSR and removed in ZTMTR (to facilitate the 
machine transplanting of succeeding rice seedlings), and incorporated in 
CTDSR/PTR, SRI treatments, respectively. Maximum residue contribu­
tion was from rice and greengram followed by wheat. A total of 29.23 to 
46.86 Mg ha−1 (megagram per hectare) of crop residue were recycled 
under different TCE methods (Table 2). To estimate the quantity of crop 
residue recycled in each treatment, the leftover crop residue (~ 30 cm 
height from ground level) of rice and wheat were cut from ground level 
using 1 m2 quadrate from four places in each plot and sun-dried to a 
constant weight and expressed on dry weight basis Mg ha−1. In case of 
greengram, total shoot dry weight excluding picked pods in 1 m2 
quadrate area from four places in each plot was considered. 
2.6. Soil temperature 
Soil temperature was measured in wheat during the season of 
2018−19 by using bent stem soil thermometers (Venus Professional 
Grade Meteorological Thermometers, Germany) graduated to 0.1 ◦C. 
The glass stem was bent 45◦about 3 cm from the bulb. To check the 
uniformity of readings, the thermometers were kept in the same kind of 
environment before the experiment. In each experimental plot, one 
thermometer was installed in north-south direction in between the crop 
rows. A rod was pushed at 5 cm depth in the sidewall of undisturbed pit 
and the thermometer was installed gently into the hole. The pit was 
filled again carefully and manually added the crop residue on the soil 
surface. Soil temperature measurement started after germination of 
wheat and continued till harvesting of crop. Soil temperatures were 
manually recorded at 6:38 a.m. and 1:48 p.m. every day as per standard 
(Yadav et al., 2012). The daily soil temperatures were calculated by 
averaging the soil temperatures at 6:38 a.m. and 1:48 p.m. The daily 
temperature was grouped according to the different crop growth stages. 
2.7. Measurement of photosynthesis 
Photosynthesis (Pn) was measured in rice (2017) and wheat during 
2018−19 on fully expanded flag leaves at anthesis stage using a portable 
infrared gas analyzer (LI-6400 Model, LICOR, USA) (Dwivedi et al., 
2018). Gas-exchange parameters were recorded between 10:00 and 
11.30 h by providing an artificial light source of 1000 μmol (photon) 
J.S. Mishra et al.

m−2 s−1. Pn was expressed as μmol (CO2) m–2 s–1. 
2.8. Earthworm population 
Earthworm populations were estimated in August 2018 by digging 
out one soil pit (0.3 m × 0.3 m × 0.3 m) in each plot and hand-sorting to 
collect and count the worms (Ashworth et al., 2017). Due care was taken 
to remove the soils attached with earthworms. The total counted 
earthworms were weighed immediately on an electronic balance. 
Earthworm biomass was expressed on a fresh weight basis. 
2.9. Economic analysis 
The economic analysis of rice-wheat-greengram cropping system 
was done during 2018−19 (after completion of 4th year of the experi­
ment). Different economic indicators were calculated based on the 
existing market price of the inputs and outputs. The total cost of culti­
vation (TC) was calculated by taking in to account the variable cost 
(excluding land rent) including costs of seeds, fertilizer, pesticide, 
human labour, machines used for land preparation, nursery raising, 
transplanting, irrigation, fertilizer application, plant protection, weed­
ing, harvesting, and threshing, etc.; and time required per hectare to 
complete an individual field activity in each treatment (Kumar et al., 
2021). Fixed cost was not considered. The labour cost incurred on 
various field operations was based on the person-days ha−1 (8 h is equal 
to 1 person-day as per the labour law of the Indian government). The 
cost of labour was estimated by multiplying labour used in all operations 
with minimum wage rate as per Govt. of India’s labour law (Minimum 
Wage Act, 1948). Gross returns (GR) were computed by multiplying the 
grain yield (Mg ha−1) of each crop by the minimum support price (MSP) 
offered by the Government of India for rice (INR 17,500 Mg ha−1), 
wheat (INR 18,400 Mg ha−1) and greengram (INR 69,750 Mg ha−1), 
while straw value was calculated using current local market rates 
(Kumar et al., 2021). Net returns (NR) were calculated as the difference 
between GR and total cost (TC) (NR = GR-TC). Benefit: cost ratio was 
worked out by dividing gross returns with total cost (B:C ratio =
GR/TC). The value of 1 US$ = 70.41 INR as per 2019 average exchange 
rate (https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/USD-INR-spot-exchange-rate 
s-history-2019.html), was considered for economic analysis. 
2.10. Energy estimation 
To calculate the total energy (renewable and non-renewable) used in 
each crop, the energy equivalent (MJ unit−1) of each input was used 
(Suppl. Table 2). Renewable energy included human labour, farmyard 
manure, seeds, and water for irrigation; and non-renewable energy 
consisted of diesel, electricity, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and farm 
machinery. Fuel consumed during each field operation, including land 
preparation, seeding, harvesting, and threshing was recorded to esti­
mate energy consumption. Energy used in irrigation was computed by 
the number of hours, the electric pump was used. The farm produce 
(grain and straw yields) was also converted into energy in terms of en­
ergy output (MJ unit−1). Based on the energy equivalents of inputs and 
outputs, energy parameters were calculated by the following equations 
(Devasenapathy et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2020a).  
Energy use efficiency = Total energy output (GJ ha−1)/Total energy input (GJ 
ha−1)                                                                                             
(7)  
Energy productivity = Crop output (kg ha−1) / Energy input (GJ ha−1)    (8)  
Specific energy = Energy input (GJ ha−1) / Crop output (kg ha−1)          (9)  
Energy intensiveness = Energy input (GJ ha−1) / Cost of cultivation (INR ha−1) 
(10)  
Net energy = Energy output (GJ ha−1) - Energy input (GJ ha−1)           (11)  
2.11. Global warming potential (GWP) 
Global warming potential (GWP) in terms of carbon dioxide equiv­
alent was calculated based on emission factors (Suppl. Table 3) associ­
ated with agricultural inputs like diesel, electricity, fertilizers, 
herbicides, pesticides. Seasonal methane (for rice only) and nitrous 
oxide emission pattern for rice, wheat and greengram were estimated 
using emission factors. Methane is produced under anoxic condition 
with redox potential lower than −0.2 V. In our study under wheat and 
greengram the fields were never under anaerobic condition and redox 
potential was much higher making unfavourable condition for methane 
emission (Jat et al., 2019d). Moreover, no burning of crop residue was 
done in field during experiment period. Therefore, only CO2 and N2O are 
taken into consideration for greenhouse gas measurement of wheat and 
greengram. However, in case of rice CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions are 
taken into calculation. Methane emission factors were taken from the 
published literature and calculation based on our field inputs. The N2O 
estimation was calculated by emission factor (0.01) multiplied with 
quantity of N applied from all sources (fertilizers, residue) and converted 
into N2O emitted with multiplication with 44/28. The formula is given 
as follows (Tubiello et al., 2015).  
N2O emission (kg ha−1season−1) = Emission factor (0.01) × amount of 
external N applied (from residue, fertilizers etc. in kg/ha) × 44/28         (12) 
Global warming potential was calculated as per Babu et al. (2020):  
GWP (kg CO2 eq. ha−1) = (emitted N2O × 298) + (emitted CH4 x 28) +
emitted CO2

2.12. Statistical analysis 
All the data on yield attributes, yield, water productivity, economics 
and energy were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) for ran­
domized complete block design using Statistix 8.1 statistical package 
(Analytical Software, Tallahassee, FL, USA; Luo et al., 2020). The dif­
ferences between treatments means were compared using least signifi­
cant difference (LSD) test at P < 0.05 (Gomez and Gomez, 1984). 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Weather 
Mean meteorological parameters during cropping seasons were 
recorded at ICAR Research Complex for Eastern Region meteorological 
observatory nearby the experimental field in Patna, Bihar, India. Among 
the different weather parameters, rainfall pattern (both amount and 
distribution) was quite variable during the four years (2015−16 to 
2018−19) of experimentation. The evidence for uncertainity of rainfall 
in the EIGP is a perennial problem and needs solution. The rainfall 
during the rice season (June–October) was the highest (921 mm) in 
2016 followed by 840 mm in 2017 and 657 mm in 2015; whereas 2018 
season received the lowest amount of rainfall (588 mm) (Fig. 1). Mean 
monthly maximum (31.8–37.0 ◦C) and minimum (20.8–27.9 ◦C) tem­
perature during rice season were almost similar in all the four years of 
study (Fig. 1). 
During wheat season (November to March) the rainfall received was 
almost negligible with maximum 17.6 mm during 2018−19. It shows 
that wheat cultivation in the region depends mainly on irrigation water. 
However, in wheat growing season, extreme temperature variations 
(sometimes high temperature at wheat sowing, and terminal heat stress 
at reproductive stage) were observed. Higher mean monthly maximum 
temperature was 2−3 ◦C higher during initial growth phase (in 
December) and during grain-filling stage (in March) 2015−16 and 
2017−18 as compared to 2016−17 and 2018−19. The mean monthly 
minimum temperature (10.4 ◦C) in January 2017 was also 3 ◦C higher 
than that in January 2018 (7.4 ◦C) (Fig. 1). Likewise, in summer 
greengram cropping season the mean monthly maximum and minimum 
temperature were comparable in all the years ranging between 35−39 
◦C and 22−28 ◦C, respectively. The total amount of rainfall varied from 
125 mm (2016) to 36 mm (2017). July to September months accounted 
for 73–87 % of the total yearly rainfall received during the study years 
(Fig. 1). 
3.2. Yield attributes and yield 
3.2.1. Rice yield attributes 
The pooled analysis of four years data showed that there was no 
significant (P < 0.05) effect of tillage and crop establishment methods 
on panicle length of rice (Table 3). However, number of panicles per 
square metre, number of grains per panicle and 1000-grains weight (g) 
were significantly altered by tillage and crop establishment methods. 
Zero-till mechanical transplanted rice (ZTMTR-ZTW-ZTG) being on par 
with direct-seeded rice (ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG and CTDSR-ZTW-ZTG), 
recorded a significantly higher (9.7–25.6 %; P < 0.05) number of pan­
icles per square metre (407) compared to transplanted rice (324–365) 
and SRI (371) (Table 3). System of rice intensification (SRI-SWI-ZTG), 
being at par with ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG and RPTR-BCW-ZTG, recorded a 
significantly higher (17.7–36.9 %) number of grains per panicle (193) 
compared to other TCE methods (141–164). The RPTR-BCW-ZTG was 
recorded significantly higher (2.8–5.4 %) 1000-grain weight (23.38 g) 
than other TCE methods (22.18–22.75 g), while the lowest value with 
CTDSR-ZTW-ZTG (22.1 g). 
3.2.2. Rice grain yield 
The yield of rice was significantly (P < 0.05) affected by tillage and 
crop establishment methods. Grain yield of rice averaged over four years 
ranged from 6.27 Mg ha−1 under ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG to 6.84 Mg ha−1 in 
LPTR- CTW-ZTG (Table 4). The grain yield during the first two years 
(2015 and 2016) was 16.2 % higher in transplanted system (PTR, MTR, 
and SRI) than direct-seeded rice (ZTDSR and CTDSR). During these two 
years, the lowest rice yield was recorded under ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG pro­
duction system. The initial reduction (14.15 %) in yield in zero-tillage 
practices compared to conventional practices (PTR, MTR) was due to 
the transition time in which soil takes time to stabilize attributing to 
increase soil stability, aggregate stability and increase soil carbon 
(Somasundaram et al., 2020). During the third year (2017), rice yield 
under 
SRI-SWI-ZTG 
was 
at 
par 
with 
CTDSR-ZTW-ZTG 
and 
ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG production system (Table 4), while yield under 
transplanted rice (PTR and MTR) reduced by 21 %. In the last year (i.e., 
2018), conventional puddled transplanted rice (LPTR and RPTR) yielded 
at par with direct-seeded rice (CTDSR and ZTDSR) but were significantly 
superior to other TCE methods. In the current study, LPTR produced a 
slightly higher (2.6–5.4 %) yield than RPTR across the years which is 
much less than 45 % reported by Awan et al. (2011). Line transplanting 
results in an optimum plant population which utilizes the resources 
more efficiently to produce a higher yield (Krishnan and Nayak, 2000). 
The data pooled over four years indicated that the grain yield of rice 
was significantly (P < 0.05) higher by 9.09 % under LPTR-CTW-ZTG and 
by 5.65 % in SRI-SWI-ZTG compared to ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG. It has been 
reported that yield loss ranges from 12 to 15% in DSR over PTR (Singh

et al., 2020a; Xu et al., 2019). However, CTDSR (6.50 Mg ha−1) yielded 
at par to MTR (6.27–6.28 Mg ha−1), PTR (6.58–6.84 Mg ha−1) and SRI 
(6.60 Mg ha−1). From the present results, it can be derived that yield was 
lower in ZT rice plots compared to CT or PTR plots, and it was in 
agreement with previous study Chakraborty et al. (2017). This yield 
penalty in DSR can be attributed to soil sickness, higher weed growth 
because of favourable conditions due to alternate wetting and drying, 
moisture stress because of higher percolation rate (Chaki et al., 2021), 
this stress could be due to nematodes and rice mealybug, higher spikelet 
sterility, etc., which poses a challenge to maintain grain yield in rice 
(Kumar et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2019; Riaz et al., 2018). These losses 
in DSR may be avoided by proper management of biotic and abiotic 
stresses. Paddy yield seems to converge towards LTPR with a yield gain 
of 9.1 % over other methods. In transplanted rice, puddling is beneficial 
for rice due to better weed control, reduction loss of water and nutrients 
through percolation, fast establishment of rice seedlings and better 
nutrient availability (Gathala et al., 2011a; Sharma et al., 2003). 
3.2.3. Wheat yield attributes 
The ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG, CTDSR-ZTW-ZTG, ZTMTR-ZTW-ZTG and 
CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG, did not have a significant effect within each other on 
the number of spikes (483−510 m−2) (Table 3), although SRI-SWI-ZTG, 
LPTR- CTW-ZTG and RPTR-BCW-ZTG reduced it (424 - 444 m−2). 
ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG recorded the highest 1000-grain weight (36.75 g) and 
significantly higher number of spikes (494 - 510 m−2), whereas RPTR- 
BCW-ZTG produced the lowest grain weight (33.95 g). The current 
study showed that tillage practices affected yield-related parameters like 
number of spikes per square meter, number of grains per spike and 1000- 
grains weight (g) in wheat crop significantly. The current study was 
agreed with many previous results where zero tillage has increased grain 
yield by 11 % compared to conventional tillage (Zamir et al., 2010) 
3.2.4. Wheat grain yield 
Wheat grain yield over four years ranged from 4.43 Mg ha−1 in SRI- 
SWI-ZTG to 4.90 Mg ha−1 under ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG (Table 4). Wheat 
yield in SRI-SWI-ZTG treatment (4.22–4.84 Mg ha−1) was similar to 
ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG (4.43–5.27 Mg ha−1) during first three years, but 
significantly lower (3.87 Mg ha−1) during 2018−19. The yield of ZT 
wheat grown after ZTMTR was 7–9.5 % higher than that obtained after 
CT MTR in all the four experimental years except in 2018−19. Wheat 
yields in SWI grown after SRI, and BCW after RPTR were significantly 
lower (8–11 %) than ZTW grown after DSR and CTW. Based on the four- 
year average, zero-till wheat (ZTW) produced 12.9 % more (560 kg ha-1) 
yield than SWI and 11.9 % higher than BCW production system, but it 
was at par with CTW (4.83 Mg ha-1) treatment. The current study clearly 
showed that as compared to other CE systems; zero tillage wheat is 
beneficial in terms of grain yield. Leaving crop residue on soil surface in 
ZT system protects soil from erosion, crusting and moisture loss through 
evaporation (Holland, 2004), and it improved carbon sequestration 
(Mondal et al., 2020), soil moisture conservation (Jat et al., 2020), 
enhanced rooting (Chaki et al., 2021), and reduces weed infestation 
(Mishra and Singh, 2012). Better wheat yield in ZTDSR - ZTW was 
observed due to saving of time in establishing crops by reducing tillage 
operations and better soil aeration and structure which facilitates good 
plant growth and yield (Singh et al., 2020b). In the present study, the 
wheat yields in CTDSR-ZTW-ZTG (4.69 Ma ha−1), LPTR-CTW-ZTG (4.83 
Mg ha−1), CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG (4.77 Mg ha−1) production system was at 
par with ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG (4.90 Mg ha−1), which also contrasted with 
previous studies (Kumar et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2020a) where yield 
under conventional wheat cultivation after puddled rice declined be­
tween 9–19 %. It calls for rigorous studies at farmers field with larger 
plot size so that the effect of smaller plots on sowing and irrigation 
operations can be minimized. The current study did not find any yield 
gain in SWI system (3.87–4.84 Mg ha−1) which was similar to the pre­
vious study Singh et al. (2020a). The conventional till drill-sown wheat 
(CTW) produced a 10.3 % higher yield than broadcast sowing (BCW) 
(Table 4). This yield loss can be attributed to poor seedling establish­
ment, more prostrate plant growth and inefficient resource utilization in 
terms of water, sunlight, or nutrients in broadcasted seeds over 
drill-sown wheat (Collins and Fowler, 1992). 
3.2.5. Greengram grain yield 
Greengram was drill-seeded in anchored wheat residue in all the TCE 
treatments. Grain yield of greengram over four years across the treat­
ments ranged from 1.18 Mg ha−1 in RPTR-BCW-ZTG to 1.42 Mg ha−1 
with CTDSR-ZTW-ZTG (Table 4). Grain yield was not affected by tillage 
and crop establishment in 2016 and 2019. However, during 2017 and 
2018, it was significantly higher (39 and 52 %) in CTDSR-ZTW-ZTG 
compared to RPTR-BCW-ZTG. Grain yield was significantly (P < 0.05) 
higher (18–20 %) when grown under DSR-ZTW production system than 
RPTR-BCW system (Table 4). As greengram was zero-tilled uniformly in 
anchored wheat residue under all the treatments, differences in yield 
among the treatments are marginal. However, DSR (CT/ZT)-based CA 
system proved its superiority over conventional system (RPTR-BCW) 
due to conducive soil conditions under DSR that might have resulted in 
better crop growth and yield.

3.2.6. Rice-wheat-greengram system productivity 
Tillage and crop establishment methods had significant effects on 
system productivity in all the years of study (Table 4). The system 
productivity (rice-equivalent yield) over four years across the tillage and 
crop establishments methods ranged from 15.57 Mg ha−1 in ZTMTR- 
ZTW-ZTG to 16.76 Mg ha−1 under LPTR-CTW-ZTG production system. 
System productivity under Conservation Agriculture system (ZTDSR- 
ZTW-ZTG) was significantly lower by 12.3 and 14.5 % compared with 
conventional system (LPTR-CTW-ZTG) in the first two years (2015−16 
and 2016−17), while it was significantly higher in the third year, and 
was at par in the fourth year. DSR (CT/ZT) based ZTW-ZTG production 
system, at par with each other, produced significantly higher REY than 
RPTR-BCW-ZTG system. Pooled average data of four-year, however, 
indicated that there was no significant effect of TCE methods on system 
productivity. In IGPs, rice is conventionally grown under puddled con­
dition with intensive tillage and shifting to DSR from traditional 
puddling requires a shift in agronomic management practices, especially 
weeds and crop residue management (Gathala et al., 2011b). Therefore, 
zero-tillage yield declines in initial years in humid climatic condition 
and matches conventional tillage practices after 2−3 years. The same 
pattern was also seen during the experiment where system productivity 
was lower by 12–15 % in the initial two years. Later in third-year, system 
yield started to increase and was at par for the fourth year. Similarly, Jat 
et al. (2014) found that in rice-wheat rotation no-till with residue 
retention showed lower yield than conventional tillage and after 4–5 
years, yield was equivalent in conservation as well as conventional 
tillage. The reason for a lower yield in initial years is ascribed to soil 
stabilization time in benefit return in terms of yield through enhanced 
soil aggregation, soil organic carbon, available soil moisture etc. (Pit­
telkow et al., 2015). 
3.3. Soil temperature 
A significant relationship was found between soil temperature and 
tillage systems. The mean soil temperature was higher in the BCW sys­
tem (20.91 ◦C) than in zero-tillage production system from germination 
to grain filling stage (Fig. 2) in wheat. On average, there was 0.5 ◦C 
improvement in soil temperature under zero-till system with full residue 
when compared to LPTR-CTW-ZTG production system. Whereas later in 
reproductive stages, temperature was low as residue acted as mulch and 
provide thermal protection by restricting the movement of cold air be­
tween soil and atmosphere Therefore, zero tillage helped in impeding 
heat loss from soil in winter and hindered soil warming in summer 
compared to conventional tillage practices (Li and Sun, 2002) 
3.4. Photosynthesis 
Photosynthesis (Pn) in rice and wheat was estimated to assess the 
CO2 assimilation efficiency under different tillage and crop establish­
ment practices. The current study results revealed that Pn was signifi­
cantly influenced under different TCE practices. The rate of Pn in rice 
was the maximum (21.7 μmol m−2 s−1) under PTR followed by SRI (20.3 
μmol m−2 s−1) (Fig. 3). The lowest Pn (17.4 μmol m−2 s−1) was recorded 
under zero-till machine transplanted rice (ZTMTR). The flag leaf 
photosynthesis in the case of wheat contributes by ~ 30–50 % of the 
assimilates for grain filling (Sylvester-Bradley et al., 1990). Therefore, 
photosynthesis of flag leaves is the most important basis for the for­
mation of the grain yield. Kumar et al. (2017) also reported that the rate 
of photosynthesis was higher in no-till (15.9 μmol m−2 s−1) as compared 
to conventional tillage (14.6 μmol m−2 s−1) in case of wheat, indicating 
the better moisture conserving ability and a lower rate of transpiratory 
water loss. 
3.5. Earthworm population 
Tillage and crop establishment methods had a significant (P < 0.05) 
effect on the population and fresh biomass of soil earthworm (Fig. 4). 
The earthworm population in CA-based production system (ZTDSR- 
ZTW-ZTG/ZTMTR-ZTW-ZTG) (32.67–33.33 numbers ft−3) was at par 
with partial-CA-based production system (CTDSR-CTW-ZTG) (27.67 
ft−3) but it was significantly higher than the rest of the TCE methods 
(16.00-17.67 ft−3). Similarly, the fresh weight of earthworm under CA- 
based production system (ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG) was significantly higher 
compared to conventional (RPTR-BCW-ZTG, CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG and SRI- 
SWI-ZTG) systems. Zero tillage has also shown powerful attraction for 
earthworm due to better soil aggregation; more photosynthetic carbon 
and available soil moisture in other contracting ecologies too (Ashworth 
et al., 2017). 
3.6. Water use and water productivity 
Of the total water used in rice-wheat-greengram cropping system, 
rice consumed 72 %, followed by wheat (16 %) and greengram (12 %) 
across the TCE methods. On a mean basis, rice grown under DSR pro­
duction system consumed significantly less water by 6.8 % compared to 
transplant system (Table 5). The total water (I + R) uses in rice ranged 
from 10,808 m3 in CA-based system to 11,963 m3 in conventional and 
SRI-based systems. The water uses in wheat (2,410−2,658 m3) and 
summer greengram (1,749−1,994 m3) did not vary significantly with 
TCE methods. But as a whole system water productivity of rice-wheat- 
greengram was much higher compared to rice-wheat system alone (re­
ported elsewhere) due to inclusion of greengram, which has a higher

J.S. Mishra et al.

market value. 
Total water use by ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG production system (15,072 m3) 
was decreased significantly by 9.3 % as compared to SRI-SWI-ZTG. The 
total 
water 
consumed 
under 
DSR-based 
cropping 
system 
(15,072−15,247 m3) was at par, but significantly lower than the rest of 
the treatments (15,777−16,614 m3), which were at par with each other 
(Table 5). During the rainy season, where PTR is managed by puddling 
and flooding with standing water depth of ±5 cm, water use was around 
7% higher than DSR where the field is only kept moist which are 
consistent with the results of (Kumar et al., 2018). In the literature, 
water saving of 20−25 % was noted with DSR over TPR (Kumar et al., 
2018). Besides, ZT-DSR with residue retention in field additionally 
helped in soil moisture retention and further reduced the irrigation 
requirement. 
The total water productivity (WP I+R) ranged from 0.52−0.67 kg 
grain m−3 in rice, 1.46–2.41 kg grain m−3 in wheat and 1.05–1.42 kg 
grain m−3 in greengram (Table 5). Water productivity is the ratio of per 
unit of water required to produce unit kg of yield. The WP of rice in DSR- 
based system was at par with puddled rice system, but increased 
significantly by 20 and 28 % compared to MTR and SRI based systems. 
Although yield under DSR was less than TPR due to less water use in 
DSR, the water productivity (0.66 kg grain m−3) was at par in both the 
systems. Secondly using zero tillage helped in additional water saving as 
residue retained not only acted as mulch but helped in reducing the 
evaporative loss. Improved WP in DSR (0.66−0.67 kg grain m−3) was 
due to reduced water usage while in ZTW (1.96–1.98 kg grain m−3) yield 
was higher. Since both the factor plays role in water productivity 
calculation hence, WP in DSR and ZTW was higher. In previous studies, 
zero tillage water productivity was 24 % more than conventional tillage 
practices (Das et al., 2014). 
System water productivity (SWP) in terms of REY under the complete 
CA-based cropping system (1.45 kg grain m−3) was at par with partial 
CA-based system (1.41 kg grain m−3) and conventional system 
(1.26–1.38 kg grain m−3) but it was significantly (P < 0.05) higher 
compared to ZTMTR-ZTW-ZTG (1.20 kg grain m−3) and SRI-SWI-ZTG 
production system (1.12 kg grain m−3) (Table 5). The reason for 
higher system productivity in CA-based production system was due to 
comparative yields and less water use owing to the surface residue

retention have been explained earlier in maize-based cropping system in 
NW India (Parihar et al., 2016). 
3.7. Economic analysis 
The cost of cultivation has differed significantly with respect to 
tillage and crop establishment methods. In rice, the total cost of pro­
duction varied in the order of: SRI > LPTR > RPTR > CTMTR > ZTMTR 
> CTDSR > ZTDSR (Table 6). The total cost of production in CTDSR and 
CTMTR was lowered by INR 9,970 (US$ 142) and INR 5,460 ha−1(US$ 
77), respectively compared to conventional system of PTR. Similarly, 
the total cost of production in ZTDSR was lower by INR 7,000 ha−1 (US$ 
99) compared to CTDSR; and in ZTMTR by INR 7,200 ha−1 (US$ 102) 
compared to CTMTR. However, the total cost of production in SRI was at 
par with conventional system (PTR). The cost of production in zero-till 
wheat (ZTW) was lower by INR 7540 (US$ 107), INR 6,540 (US$ 93), 
and INR 4,500 (US$ 64) ha−1 compared to SWI, BCW and CTW. Since 
summer greengram was grown under zero-till system in all the treat­
ments, cost of production (INR 32,400 ha−1) (US$ 460 ha−1) was the 
same. At system level, the highest cost of production was incurred in 
SRI-SWI-ZTG (INR 1,34,970 or US$ 1,917 ha−1) followed by RPTR- 
BCW-ZTG (INR 1,31,470 or US$ 1,867 ha−1) and LPTR-BCW-ZTG 
(INR 1,30,990 ha−1). The CA-based production system (ZTDSR-ZTW- 
ZTG/ZTMTR-ZTW-ZTG) was recorded the lowest cost of production 
(INR 1,08,730/1,13,040 ha−1) (US$ 1,544/1,605 ha−1) followed by 
CTDSR-ZTW-ZTG production system (INR 1,15,730 or US$ 1,644 ha−1). 
The cost reduction was principally due to a decrease in 4–5 tillage 
operation as reported elsewhere (Jat et al., 2019a). 
Tillage and crop establishment methods had a significant (P < 0.05) 
effect on net returns from rice, wheat, greengram and at system level 
(Table 6). Net returns from rice was maximum (INR 82,360 or US$ 1,170 
ha−1) under CA-based system (ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG) followed by partial CA 
system (INR 78,330 or US$ 1,112 ha−1). The lowest NR (INR 47,380 or 
US$ 673 ha−1) in rice was realized under SRI followed by MTR (INR 
59,820-61,770 ha−1) (US$ 850-877 ha−1). Zero-till wheat grown in 
CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG system fetched the maximum NR (INR 70,430 or US$ 
1,000 ha−1) followed by CA-system (INR 57,000 or US$ 810 ha−1). The 
lowest NR in wheat (INR 39,580 or US$ 562 ha−1) was recorded under 
SWI. Broadcast wheat (BCW) fetched significantly lower NR by INR 
11,790 ha−1 (US$ 167 ha−1) as compared to drill-sown wheat (CTW). 
Previous studies also reported higher net returns from zero tillage 
(Erenstein, 
2002). 
During 
summer 
season, 
greengram 
under 
CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG production system being on a par with CA-based 
system gave higher net returns (INR 1,41,280 or US$ 2,007 ha−1) than 
the rest of the TCE methods (INR 1,04,310–1,28,030 ha−1) (US$ 1, 
481–1,818 ha−1). At the system level, the net returns ranged from INR 2, 
77,140 or US$ 3,936 ha−1 in CA-based production system to INR 1,90, 
340 or US$ 2,703 ha−1 under SRI-SWI-ZTG system. LPTR-CTW-ZTG 
method fetched the higher net returns of INR 40,770 ha−1 compared 
to RPTR-BCW-ZTG; and CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG by INR 49,650 or US$ 705 
ha−1 compared to ZTMTR-ZTW-ZTG production system. 
At the system level, the current study may draw comfort from the fact 
that productivity of CA based system may not improve every year, but 
net profits stayed higher than conventional methods. Long term pros­
pects are also higher for improving water productivity and energy use. 
That is where the cost has come down. From this four-year study, it can 
be concluded that an amount of INR 19,610–60,400 ha−1 yr−1 could be 
saved by adopting CA-based system over conventional rice-wheat- 
greengram system. Similar results were obtained in a long-term (10 
years) study on reducing tillage practices in rice-maize system that gave 
a profit of 225–1,028 US$ ha−1 yr−1 over conventional system (Jat et al., 
2019b). 
Among all the three crops, greengram had a higher B:C ratio 
(4.22–5.36) compared to rice (1.71–2.95) and wheat (1.75–3.07). Even 
after adjusting yield levels, all crop establishment methods of rice had B: 
C ratio in a range of 2.3–3.0 compared to B:C ratio of 1.7 from SRI). Zero- 
till wheat grown after CTMTR had the highest B:C ratio (3.07) and BCW 
has the lowest ratio of 2.1. 
The lowest B:C ratio (1.75) in wheat was observed under SWI. At the 
system level, B:C ratio was in the order of ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG (3.62) =
CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG (3.51) = CTDSR-ZTW-ZTG (3.33) > ZTMTR-ZTW- 
ZTG (3.07) > SRI-SWI-ZTG production system (2.66). Higher B: C 
ratio in greengram was due to higher minimum support price (INR 
69,750 t−1), which fetched higher gross returns than rice and wheat. 
Most important point to focus on is due to the intensification of the 
system net return of rice-wheat-greengram system as a whole has 
increased almost double to US$ 4,767 ha−1yr−1 compared to only rice- 
wheat system under Conservation Agriculture (US$ 2,300 ha−1 yr−1) as 
reported by Jat et al. (2014) in his studies based on 2013-dollar values or 
2,900 ha−1yr−1 (Gathala et al., 2015). 
3.8. Energy budgeting 
This study compared the energy analysis between different crop 
establishment methods. The energy required in raising crops varied from 
42.5 to 49.91 GJ ha−1. Among the crops under study, the energy 
required by rice was higher followed by wheat, while greengram used 
the lowest energy (Table 7). The highest energy consumption by rice

mainly attributed to high fertilizer use, tillage practices and labour 
(Babu et al., 2020). The DSR-based cropping system had a significantly 
(P < 0.05) lower energy requirement compared to PTR-based system. 
The total energy requirement under Conservation Agriculture-based 
system was 14.87 % lower than that of conventional system. 
In the case of puddled transplanted rice and conventional wheat, the 
total energy input was higher; in which PTR took maximum labour 
(transplanting, weeding, harvesting, threshing) as well as a high amount 
of diesel used mainly for puddling which adds to the input energy (Mitra 
et al., 2018). Total energy requirement in rice and wheat (16.87 and 
17.91 GJ ha−1) under CA based system (ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG) was signifi­
cantly lower by 24.28 and 9.86 % than conventional (PTR-CTW) system 
(Table 7). The total input energy in greengram (7.22 GJ ha−1) was 
similar in all the treatments. Reduced energy requirement in rice and 
wheat under zero-tillage was mainly due to less input in terms of labour, 
diesel used for tillage and water irrigation (Babu et al., 2020; Mitra et al., 
2018). The energy output in rice, wheat and greengram under different 
treatments 
ranged 
from 
142.87–180.31, 
116.89–143.90 
and 
28.81–36.60 GJ ha-1, respectively. The energy output in rice (180.31 G J 
ha-1) under RPTR-BCW-ZTG treatment was at par to CTDSR-ZTW-ZTG 
(173.41 
GJ 
ha-1) 
ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG 
(164.41 
GJ 
ha-1) 
and 
LPTR-CTW-ZTG (162.45 GJ ha-1), but significantly higher compared to 
other treatments. In wheat, CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG production system being 
at par with DSR-based and PTR-based systems recorded significantly 
higher (23 %) output energy over SRI-SWI-ZTG system. Biomass and 
straw yield in rice and wheat establishment methods were at par which 
is being reflected in terms of output energy. 
In greengram, CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG (36.60 GJ ha−1) being at par with 
ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG (35.87 GJ ha−1) and RPTR-BCW-ZTG (33.81 GJ ha−1) 
recorded significantly higher energy output compared to other treat­
ments. The system output energy ranged from 296.48 GJ ha−1 under 
SRI-SWI-ZTG to 353.01 MJ ha−1 under RPTR-BCW-ZTG (Table 7). The 
higher energy output in RPTR-based system was due to higher rice straw 
yield. The energy output under CA-based production system (ZTDSR- 
ZTW-ZTG) was 15 % higher than SRI-SWI-ZTG system. 
To judge the system efficiency economic analysis is determined. 
More efficient system is that which consumes less energy and gives a 
higher output (Yadav et al., 2017). To estimate which system is more 
energy-efficient different indices have been used. In general, the energy 
use efficiency (EUE) was found higher than those of only rice-wheat 
system followed elsewhere. The study results showed that the inclu­
sion of legumes especially summer greengram is more efficient in terms 
of EUE (Soni et al., 2018). The EUE ranged from 6.44–9.75, 6.04–7.85 
and 3.73–4.65 in rice, wheat and greengram, respectively (Table 7). The 
EUE of all three crops was significantly higher under CA-based cropping 
system (4.27–9.75) compared to conventional (LPTR- CTW-ZTG) 
(3.73–7.28) and (SRI-SWI-ZTG) (3.98–6.88) systems. The lowest EUE 
in rice (6.44) was recorded with CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG followed by 
SRI-SWI-ZTG (6.88) and ZTMTR-ZTW-ZTG (6.86) systems. Wheat in 
SRI-SWI-ZTG system (6.04), and greengram in LPTR- CTW-ZTG (3.73) 
had the lowest EUE. Energy use efficiency of the system varied from 6.09 
to 8.02 being the lowest in SRI-based production system and the highest 
in CA-based production system. Similar results showed higher energy 
efficiency in zero-tillage followed by reduced and conventional tillage in 
pigeonpea-castor system (Pratibha et al., 2015). As energy use efficiency 
is the ratio of output energy to input energy, it can be derived that 
CA-based production system had lesser input energy and produced at 
par output energy compared to conventional system which enhanced its 
overall energy use efficiency (Jat et al., 2019c) 
The current study results showed that energy productivity (EP) (kg 
grain produced per GJ energy consumed) in rice, wheat and greengram 
varied from 0.277−0.422, 0.200−0.312 and 0.254−0.325 kg GJ−1, 
respectively (Table 7). Here in the study, a significantly higher energy 
productivity in rice (0.422 kg GJ−1) was observed in the CA-based rice- 
wheat-greengram cropping system, which was 12.8 % higher than 
partial CA-based production system (CTDSR-ZTW-ZTG) and 29.8 % than

conventional system (LPTR- CTW-ZTG). In wheat, CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG 
was recorded significantly higher EP (0.312 kg GJ−1) by 56 % over 
SRI-SWI-ZTG (0.20 kg GJ−1). The highest system EP in terms of REY 
(0.519 kg GJ−1) was achieved under CA-based production system, which 
was 10 % higher over CTDSR-based system and 14–36 % higher than 
PTR-based systems which also agreed with Jat et al. (2019c). Specific 
energy (calorific values required to produce 1 kg grain) ranged 
from1.42–2.14, 1.70–2.23 and 3.10–3.94 GJ kg-1 for rice, wheat and 
greengram, respectively (Table 7). Rice produced with CA-based system 
required 33.6, 29.0 and 25.3 % less specific energy compared to con­
ventional CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG, SRI-SWI-ZTG and LPTR-CTW-ZTG sys­
tems, respectively. In wheat, CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG (1.70 GJ kg−1), being at 
par with ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG (1.73 GJ kg−1) consumed significantly lower 
specific energy as compared to SRI-SWI-ZTG (2.23 GJ kg−1). A similar 
trend (3.10-3.94 GJ kg−1) was observed in case of greengram. The sys­
tem specific energy was also recorded the lowest in CA-based production 
system (1.72 GJ kg−1), and the highest (2.26 GJ kg−1) under 
SRI-SWI-ZTG. These results (Table 7) indicated that various tillage and 
crop establishment methods had little difference in energy intensive­
ness, except in rice, where SRI-SWI-ZTG system recorded significantly 
lower value of energy intensiveness (0.35 MJ INR−1) compared to 
ZTMTR-ZTW-ZTG production system (0.45 GJ INR-1). The net energy 
(NE) 
values 
ranged 
from 
122.04–158.03, 
97.53–125.99 
and 
21.10–28.89 GJ ha−1 in rice, wheat and greengram, respectively 
(Table 7). In rice, RPTR-BCW-ZTG system (158.03 GJ ha−1) was at par 
with CTDSR-ZTW-ZTG (153.93 GJ ha−1) and ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG (147.55 
GJ ha−1) systems, but recorded significantly higher (29.5 %) NE over 
ZTMTR-ZTW-ZTG (122.04 GJ ha−1). The lowest NE in wheat (97.53 GJ 
ha−1) was attained with SRI-SWI-ZTG, which was 20.5 and 22.6 % lower 
than ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG and CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG systems. In greengram, 
the highest NE (28.89 GJ ha−1) was obtained with CTMTR-ZTW-ZTG, 
and lowest (21.10 GJ ha−1) with LPTR- CTW-ZTG system. The system 
net energy ranged from 247.78 GJ ha-1 in SRI-SWI-ZTG to 303.17 GJ 
ha-1 in RPTR-BCW-ZTG. CA-based production system (298.43 GJ ha−1) 
produced 8.5 and 20.4 % higher net energy than LPTR- CTW-ZTG and 
SRI-SWI-ZTG systems. From all these energy observation, it is evident 
that CA-based production system with low input use and higher or at par 
output energy makes it more energy efficient system. Moreover, energy 
efficient CA-based system provides possibilities to intensify the 
rice-wheat system with the inclusion of legume crop as greengram which 
makes system more productive and efficient in terms of energy (Becerril 
and Rios, 2016). 
3.9. Global warming potential 
The global warming potential of different rice treatments showed 
that ZTDSR had the lowest and CTMTR, SRI, CTDSR, PTR had 15.5 11.3 
%, 11.1 % and 9 % higher GWP (Table 8). With a change in rice tillage 
practices from PTR, ZTDSR has 56.2 % less methane emission. Under 
puddled soil methane is emitted under anaerobic condition in sub­
merged soil by the methanogenesis process (Le Mer and Roger, 2001). As 
compared ZTDSR field were only kept moist which released less 
methane from soil (Jain et al., 2014). In a study, Gupta et al. (2016) 
reported that PTR treatments had 82–87 % higher emission compared to 
DSR. However, in the current study, the reduction was less (56.2 %) 
since DSR was under zero-tillage, where residue act as methane sources 
under irrigated condition. In case of nitrous oxide, emission was 28 % 
higher in ZTDSR compared to PTR which was because of alternate 
wetting and drying favouring nitrification and denitrification process 
(Jain et al., 2014). Major contributors towards higher GWP from PTR 
was due to diesel and methane emission, while fertilizer and herbicide 
emission rate was constant for both the systems. The present study re­
sults emphasized that puddling for which intensive tillage is required 
uses more diesel and provides anoxic environment for methanogens to 
act for higher GWP. Moreover, the GWP of zero-till wheat was 11.3 % 
lower than conventional till wheat. In wheat, major contributors to 
greenhouse gas emission are the use of electricity, diesel, fertilizer and 
herbicide use. Diesel was the most important factor for higher GWP of 
CTW, as in zero-till system, diesel use emitted 32.16 kg CO2 eq. emission 
compared to 150.08 kg CO2 eq. emission from CTW system (Table 8). 
Although N2O emission was 12 % higher in ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG system 
compared to LPTR-CTW-ZTG as zero-till wheat. Results are similar to

Bhatia et al. (2010) and Gupta et al. (2016) where ZTW had 8–12 % 
higher N2O emission compared to CTW. Higher N2O emission from ZTW 
may be due to higher compaction with higher bulk density and soil 
moisture which reduces oxygen diffusion rate favouring anaerobic 
condition under which more nitrous oxide is emitted (Gupta et al., 
2016). Greengram under all the crop establishment methods was done 
under zero tillage condition with global warming potential of 241.81 
(Table 8). The GWP of rice-wheat-greengram system averaged over four 
years varied from 1,925−2,114 kg CO2 eq. ha−1. System of 
ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG where DSR followed by ZTW followed by ZTG showed 
significantly the lowest GWP. These treatments led to 8–10 % lower 
GWP than conventional establishment methods. Zero tillage combined 
with crop residue retention reduce GHG emission (Wassmann et al., 
2009), increase carbon sequestration in uppermost soil layer (Li et al., 
2020; Modak et al., 2019), reduce emission of methane (Metay et al., 
2007) and CO2 (Reeves et al., 2001); and save irrigation water and 
diesel. Similar results were obtained by Gupta et al. (2016) where 
DSR-ZTW in IGPs showed a 44–47 % reduction in GWP in rice-wheat 
system.

the treatment rice contribution in total GWP was 45–48 % in which 
conventional system contributed 48 % while conservation system 
contribution was 45 %. The current study results favoured the adoption 
of zero-till production system due to its benefit in terms of mitigating 
greenhouse gas emission from agriculture. 
3.10. Follow-up research and scaling-up possibilities 
Intensive tillage-based conventional rice-wheat production system of 
the IGP of South Asia has led to a decline in productivity, input-use ef­
ficiency, and profitability; besides being energy and C-intensive. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative eco-friendly produc­
tion systems that may be more productive and profitable; efficient user 
of energy, water, and carbon-based inputs. The present study demon­
strated that as compared to conventional system, intensified CA-based 
approach (ZTDSR-ZTW-ZTG) in RWCS was more sustainable. Howev­
er, DSR is not always possible in this EIGP regions that are prone to 
heavy rainfall at the time of sowing. This results in establishment failure 
due to crust formation or water logging after seeding. Mechanical 
seeding is either not possible or delayed due to wet soil condition. Under 
such situations, ZTMTR may be a good alternative for timely crop 
establishment. Since, weed management is a critical issue in DSR, suit­
able integration of pre-and post-emergence herbicides/herbicide 
mixture in presence of crop residue for broad-spectrum weed manage­
ment needs to be developed under varying soil types and moisture re­
gimes. More cover crops for sustainable intensification of RWCS need to 
be evaluated for weed suppression and allelopathic potential. As the 
EIGP is dominated by small and marginal farmers with lower per capita 
income, there is a need to strengthen the service providers in the region 
to scale out these profitable, but capital-intensive production options for 
smallholders. 
4. Conclusion 
To address the issues of declining productivity and profitability, 
deteriorating soil health, water scarcity, labour shortage, and climate 
change etc., Conservation Agriculture (CA)-based crop management 
practices are being developed and popularized in the IGP of South Asia. 
However, most of the CA technologies are confined to ZT-wheat in rice- 
wheat system with partial or no crop residue retention in EIGP, lacking 
system’s approach and crop diversification. The present study clearly 
demonstrates that shifting from conventional system to an intensified 
CA-based approach in RWCS can reduce the cost of production with 
similar or higher yields, and improve water productivity and profit­
ability. The current study also suggests that the CA-based system was 
more energy-efficient and eco-friendly with lower system global 
warming potential. The information generated from this study would 
enhance the knowledge and strengthen the database of policymakers 
and researchers for promoting safer, cleaner, sustainable as well as 
productive climate-resilient cropping systems in the IGP of South Asia to 
achieve the ‘Sustainable Development Goals’. More long-term studies 
under varying soil types and management would be beneficial in order 
to increase the impact and large-scale adoption of these technologies in 
the EIGP.
