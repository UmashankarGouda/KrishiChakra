Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is transforming all the fields  including agriculture, by providing data driven insights, which has 
enhanced and transformed the decision making process. Recent advancements in sensor technology, Wireless Communications, GPS and 
Data Analytics has led to widespread use by farmers which has led to increased resource utilization and efficiency and means to practice 
sustainable farming. In the proposed method various ML models are used to forecast two crucial metrics for precision agriculture Growing 
Degree Days (GDD) and Evapotranspiration (ET), which can be used for effectively managing daily agricultural activities. They are useful 
in predicting growth stages of crops, pest warnings, fertilizer usage, and irrigation times. Hourly data collected though sensors and other 
sources such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and soil moisture is used in managing real time growth of crops. The study assessed 
machine learning models like Random Forest, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Voting Regressor, Stacking Regressor, and Decision Trees 
for precision agriculture metrics. Random Forest performed best but struggled with ET ranges. Decision Tree showed potential overfitting 
and underperformed, Voting Regressor and Stacking Regressor showed high performance. Despite hyper parameter optimization, the 
artificial neural network (ANN) exhibited poor performance, suggesting issues with either model selection or data adherence. The study 
developed a Decision Support System (DSS) that uses GDD and ET forecasts to provide real-time recommendations for pest and disease 
risk, fertilizer usage, crop maturation stages and watering regimens. The aim of this system is to equip farmers with the necessary tools to 
efficiently and effectively oversee their farms, hence enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.

1. Introduction 
Agriculture is the ancient art of growing crops and rearing cattle. 
It led to the formation of villages and the development of 
civilizations. It was one of the earliest means of employment and 
trade for humans. Over time, people invented various tools and 
machinery to increase productivity and simplify agriculture. 
Farmers still use traditional farming methods and rely on their 
experience. As the population across the globe rises, so does the 
need to produce more in order to keep up with the increasing 
demands. Although Agriculture 3.0 practices have led to increased 
yields, they also have adverse effects on the environment, such as 
soil exploitation, water and groundwater contamination, air 
pollution, and increased resistance in pests [1]. One of the primary 
reasons is a lack of knowledge and resource exploitation. There is 
a dire need to upgrade the farming method to include technology 
and sustainability. In today's technology- and AI-driven world, the 
use of data-driven AI tools and machine learning models to 
increase productivity, give better insights to include climate  
changes, determine pest cycles, and suggest fertilizer and pesticide  
amounts, using sensors for irrigation, and better crop monitoring is 
on the rise. With irrigation monitoring, farmers can now prevent 
under- and over-irrigation, prepare for rainfall and climate change, 
and also practice deficit irrigation in the right phase of the crop. 
The quality and quantity of the yield can be improved and 
predicted so that the farmers can prepare themselves beforehand 
and take proper measures to ensure maximum profits [2] [3]. 
Pesticide and fertilizer amounts and exact application times can be 
calculated, pests can be modelled, and preventive sprays can be 
suggested. Parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil 
temperature, soil moisture, wind speed, solar radiation, 
precipitation, soil nutrient values, historical datasets, satellite 
photos, RGB images, and spectral images are being utilized to 
construct machine learning models and extract valuable crop 
information [4]. The plant development and irrigation needs can be 
estimated 
by 
using 
growing 
degree 
days 
(GDD) 
and 
evapotranspiration (ET). 
 
In this paper, we build various ML models to fit our data and 
analyze them using various metrics. The model gets insights on the 
crop stages, irrigation needs and fertilizer needs of the crops. Fig 1 
shows the system overview of the proposed work to be carried out 
for the DSS model. The following section contains the previous 
works carried out, followed by the methodology and results.

2. Literature Review 
Significant efforts are being made in the field of smart 
agriculture 
to 
enhance 
crop 
monitoring, 
water 
management, soil conditioning, disease prediction and 
identification, insect detection and identification, weed 
detection, animal management, yield prediction, and 
harvest management, among others [9].  
Data acquisition using sensors is important for taking real 
time decisions and monitoring. Abba, S et al. developed a 
low-cost autonomous sensor interface for an Internet of 
Things (IoT)-based smart irrigation monitoring and 
control system. The system makes use of a water pump to 
supply water, a moisture sensor to determine the water 
content of the soil, and a WiFi module to enable internet-
based data access.  Data is sent to thing speak and is 
analysed and decision to switch on and off the motor are 
taken. The model can be used in large scale farms for easy 
monitoring and tracking of crops [5]. System developed 
by Farzad Kiani and Amir Seyyedabbasi collects 
temperature, humidity and soil moisture data via sensor 
nodes and sends it via gateway and is displayed on a GUI. 
The farm is divided into four parts and hourly data is 
collected from nodes in each part of the farm [6]. The goal 
of the model by Saha, G. C. et al. is to create an Internet 
of Things (IoT)-based system that monitors temperature 
and moisture content in agricultural fields and gives 
farmers useful data for crop management. To collect real-
time data, the system makes use of a GSM module, an 
ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, a moisture sensor, and an LM 35 
temperature sensor [7].  
With the widespread use and rapid progress of machine 
learning and artificial intelligence techniques, they are 
being used to simplify various aspects of the world. One 
of the author modelled a web interface that facilitates easy 
access for farmers. Ten different algorithms were tested 
for crop recommendation in which the Random Forest 
classifier that was hyper tuned with Randomized cross 
validation proved to be the most effective model. Based 
on variables like the pH of the soil and typical rainfall, the 
system forecasted five crops. Longitude and latitude 
values are entered by the user and sent to the Weather API. 
The system can also have a pesticides and weeds detector. 
Weeds are predicted by the Weeds RESNET152V2 pre-
trained algorithm with an accuracy of 0.89, and insects are 
predicted by the same method with an accuracy of 0.98. 
Agricultural costs were predicted using data sets from 
2010 to 2018, which had data for 11 crops [8]. Regression 
models such as Gradient Boosting Regressor, Decision 
Tree Regressor, Bagging Regressor and XGBoost 
regressors were used and their R2 scores were compared. 
The data-driven approach for developing Precision 
Agriculture solutions for data modelling and collection 
systems is presented in [9]. In this research soil moisture, 
a crucial component of the crop growth cycle, is selected 
as an example. Utilizing the MicaZ mote and VH400 soil 
moisture sensor, a reactive wireless sensor node is created 
for the collection side of soil moisture and the prototype 
gadget is tested in field soil. For data analysis, machine 
learning methods SVM (support vector machine) and 
RVM (relevance vector machine) are used for predicting 
soil moisture. Methodology is evaluated using Illinois 
historical data as the machine learning algorithms require 
enormous data sizes. When predicting soil moisture it 
produces low error rates (15%) and strong correlations 
(95%) between anticipated values and actual values across 
in nine distinct sites for 2 weeks period.

Crop Yield Prediction needs are assessed in a study used 
by Tamil Nadu paddy data which has 745 data points.  
Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Regression, K-
Nearest Neighbour, and Random Forest (RF) ml 
algorithms are used on the same dataset. The RF algorithm 
has the highest accuracy based on error analysis values. A 
survey talks about agriculture 4.0 and its major 
requirements. It gives a systematic literature review of 
thirteen chosen decision-support agricultural systems. 
These systems were graded, and advantages and 
disadvantages were highlighted [10]. Future challenges 
and improvements were suggested and a hybrid MLR-
ANN algorithm is proposed for yield prediction of paddy 
crops. MLR intercept and coefficients are used to initialize 
ANN input bias and weights. The model is compared to 
Support Vector Regression, k-Nearest Neighbor, MLR, 
ANN and Random Forest models and is found to be more 
accurate [11] [12].  
Growing Degree-days offer a method to approximate the 
pace of growth of plants, insects, fungus, and other 
creatures by utilising the highest and lowest temperatures 
recorded on an hourly or daily basis. Degree-days quantify 
the cumulative heat accumulated by plants during a 
specific period. Evapotranspiration (ET) refers to the 
collective processes of water evaporation from both soil 
and plant surfaces, as well as the water transpiration via 
plant tissues. Food and Agriculture Organizations of 
United Nations (FAO) Penman-Monteith equation is used 
to estimate ET based on Weather conditions and the crop 
conditions. ET can be used to estimate the water 
requirements so that maximum yield can be achieved with 
the available water [13]. 
In the proposed system we use ML algorithms to analyse 
and calculate GDD and evapotranspiration to give daily 
crop updates to the farmers 
3. Methodology 
Smart crop management deals with geographical, 
environmental, periodical and technological feasible 
quantities, that increase the internal visibility of farming.  
Every aspect of the surroundings, including soil qualities, 
climates, water availability, nutrients, humidity levels, and 
temperatures. Because of their losses farmers find it 
extremely difficult to farm. With fewer inputs and greater 
efficiency, smart farming generates more outputs, using 
digital technologies to enhance farming methods. Various 
technological advances are altering the limitations and 
forms of agricultural intelligence. The two main themes 
are machine learning methods and Internet of Things 
sensors. 
Fig 2. Work flow chart 
 3.1 Data Collection 
 Open-source datasets were employed for the proposed 
system to validate the results. The publicly accessible data 
from NREL was utilised for the decision support system, 
with location specific parameters to suit the environment 
were used. Sensing quantities that require more cost were 
extracted from open source data and farm sensitive data 
was captured for approximately 3 and half months. The 
parameters such as atmospheric temperature, soil 
temperature, Humidity and soil moisture (primary and 
secondary root) content was captured from the sensor 
module prototype.  
3.2 Data Pre-processing  
Obtained datasets had missing and erroneous values that 
were properly identified to clear possible inefficiencies in 
the data. The dataset errors are the common causes of the 
poor performance of the model, improper analysis of data 
could lead to inaccurate decision making system for 
farmers and troubling them in handling technology. GDD 
and ET are calculated based on FAO drainage paper 56 
[13].   
3.3 Proposed Method 
The process of choosing a model starts with the analysis 
of sensors from the survey, the literature suggests that the 
ML model choice of Random Forest, Support Vector 
Regression (SVR), Voting Regressor, Stacking Regressor, 
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Decision Tress 
would be efficient for the datasets collected. The data 
availability was for each hour for parameters like 
temperature, humidity, wind speed, soil temperature, soil 
moisture at the primary root and soil moisture at the 
secondary root. The prime output that every researcher is 
targeting to predict is crop yield, but the difficulty in 
accurate prediction and real-time crop yield data 
availability is the primary concern.  
To primarily address the day-to-day issues of farmers 
rather than crop yield, Growing degree days (GDD) and 
Evapotranspiration (ET) can be considered as the response 
variables for prediction. In the proposed work primarily 
GDD and ET are considered for the analysis and 
prediction. The GDD though is a formulated quantity, but 
in addition, it is being examined with respect to other 
parameters such as humidity, soil moisture, Soil 
temperature and wind speed. It was observed that the GDD 
and ET have the additional capability to predict the stage 
of maturity of the crop, Pest alert and fertilizer usage for 
the crop with irrigation schedule, which could be more 
important for a farmer to protect the crop apart from the 
yield prediction.  
So the proposed methodology is to use GDD and ET 
values prediction from real-time data, the method 
considers the implementation of above said models for 
training to predict GDD and ET values concerning non-
formulated features and create a decision support 
system(DSS) for the farmer. The DSS system proposed 
would be able to take real-time inputs from the sensors, 
analyze and give time-lined predictions for the farmer to 
prevent frequent manual intervention and for easy and 
effective management of the farm. Using future 
predictions of GDD the system can estimate various stages 
of the crop and its requirements. By utilizing those 
insights, Farmers can equip themselves with all the

necessities required such as irrigation times, fertilizers, 
pesticides, 
manpower, 
warehouse 
spaces, 
and 
transportation. 
4. Results and Discussion 
The process of prediction considered totally five ML 
algorithms for analysis, namely Random Forest, Decision 
Tree, SVR, Voting Regressor and Stacking Regressor. 
Cross Validation and Hyperparameter optimization were 
also considered. The growing degree days (GDD) and 
evapotranspiration (ET) were two critical indicators for 
smart agriculture decision support systems, the measures 
set out to evaluate performance of these models after 
prediction. Among the evaluation metrics used are the 
coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error 
(MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The 
accuracy, robustness, and generalizability of each model 
are revealed by these metrics as shown in Table 1. 
Table 1. Model interpretation for proposed dataset 
 
 It was observed that while modelling and evaluating 
performance parameters Artificial neural network was 
used in literature, hence ANN was also considered for the 
proposed work. But the performance of ANN continued to 
be unsatisfactory even after adjustments, suggesting 
potential problems with the selection of the model or 
compatibility with the data. Hyper parameter optimization 
enhanced the performance of certain models, such as the 
Decision Tree, but did not yield significant improvements 
as shown in Table 2.

Table 3 and table 4 shows the obtained metric values of 
the evaluated models. Fig 3 to Fig 11 shows the actual and 
predicted values of different ML algorithms used to 
analyse the system. The plots clearly show that most of the 
predicted points are near to the hyper plane line, 
confirming the models showing good performance for 
prediction. Among these Random Forest model has 
performed the best in predicting GDD (R² = 0.98) and ET 
(R² = 0.94), but couldn’t model ET ranges properly (R² = 
0.508). The Decision Tree model results were a perfect 
match with the training data (R² = 1.00), potentially 
indicating an issue of overfitting.  It also showed a below-
average performance for ET (R² = 0.265).

Table 5. Sample Predicted results 
 
 
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with an R-
squared value of 0.88 showed good performance for GDD. 
However, the performance for ET was subpar, with a R-
squared value of 0.58. The Voting Regressor and Stacking 
Regressor have estimated GDD and ET with R² values for 
GDD (0.98 and 0.95) and ET (0.92 and 0.86) which shown 
high performance, but the Voting Regressor displayed 
instability in its ET predictions. The predicted sample 
results are shown in Table 5 for Random Forest predicted 
model, showing various recommendations for the system. 
5. Conclusion 
The 
examination 
of 
several 
regression 
models 
demonstrates clear advantages and disadvantages in 
forecasting 
Growing 
Degree 
Days 
(GDD) 
and 
Evapotranspiration (ET). The Random Forest model 
demonstrates exceptional performance, attaining a R² 
score of 0.98 for GDD and 0.94 for ET, while also 
reducing the RMSE. It faced difficulties in accurately 
representing the range of values in ET. The Decision Tree 
model demonstrates  perfect alignment with the training 
data which could potentially be a sign of overfitting, and 
showed poor performance for ET. The Support Vector 
Regressor (SVR) demonstrates a good level of prediction 
accuracy for GDD but underperformed for ET. Both the 
Voting Regressor and Stacking Regressor displayed high 
R² values, indicating their potential for reliable 
predictions, though both showed volatility in ET 
predictions. Hyperparameter optimization improved the 
performance of some models, it did not significantly 
enhance the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), pointing to 
potential 
issues 
with 
model 
selection 
or 
data 
compatibility. Random Forest Regressor showing superior 
performance among individual models. These findings 
underscore the importance of careful model selection and 
optimization to improve prediction accuracy in precision 
agriculture, ultimately aiding farmers in better managing 
their resources and enhancing crop yields.
