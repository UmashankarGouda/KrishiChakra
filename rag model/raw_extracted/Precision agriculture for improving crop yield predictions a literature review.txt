Precision agriculture (PA) is a data-driven, technology-enabled farming 
management strategy that monitors, quantiﬁes, and examines the 
requirements of speciﬁc crops and ﬁelds. A key aim of precision agricultural 
technologies is to optimize crop yield and quality, while also working to lower 
operating costs and minimize environmental impact. This approach not only 
enhances productivity but also promotes sustainable farming practices. In PA, it is 
essential to leverage effective monitoring through sensing technologies, 
implement robust management information systems, and proactively address 
both inter- and intravariability within cropping systems. Crop yield simulations 
using deep learning and machine learning (ML) techniques aid in understanding 
the combined effects of pests, nutrient and water shortages, and other ﬁeld 
variables during the growing season. On the other hand, remote sensing 
techniques such as lidar imagery, radar, and multi- and hyperspectral data 
presents valuable opportunities to enhance yield predictions by improving the 
understanding of soil, climate, and other biophysical factors affecting crops. This 
paper aims to highlight key gaps and opportunities for future research, focusing 
on the evolving landscape of remote sensing and machine learning techniques 
employed to enhance predictions of crop yield. In future, PA is likely to include 
more focused use of sensor platforms and ML techniques can enhance the 
effectiveness of agricultural practices. Additionally, the development of hybrid 
systems that combine diverse ML approaches and signal processing techniques 
will pave the way for more innovative and efﬁcient solutions in the ﬁeld.

1 Introduction 
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2030 and beyond, heat 
stress, starvation, and disease would cause 250,000 fatalities yearly, demonstrating the real 
and dangerous effects of climate change (WHO, 2023). In addition to the uncertain and 
unforeseen future that climate change would bring, it is predicted that by 2050, there will be

9.6 billion people on the planet (UN Report, 2024). Malnutrition is 
already a major global concern, and climate change is making food 
production even more stressful globally. Despite their dependence 
on steady and regular weather patterns, agricultural practices 
nonetheless have a major role in climate change. The use of 
nitrogen-based fertilizers, on-farm waste management, fuel 
consumption, and biological sources (such as enteric fermentation 
by cattle) account for the majority of agricultural emissions 
(ECCC, 2021). 
Precision agriculture (PA), which uses modern methods to 
increase crop yield while consuming the fewest resources possible, 
represents a substantial departure from conventional agricultural 
systems (Karunathilake et al., 2023; Rebouh et al., 2023a). Precision 
agriculture is a data-driven approach that analyzes and manages 
ﬁeld variability using a variety of tools, including sensors, drones, 
GPS guidance systems, and machine learning algorithms (Linaza 
et al., 2021). In order to make well-informed decisions pertaining to 
certain areas of their farm, farmers can use this technique to 
evaluate changes in crop health, soil composition, and moisture 
levels (Case-Cohen, 2018) (Figure 1). By effectively using farm 
inputs like fertilizer, herbicides, and water through real-time data 
gathering and analysis, precision agriculture seeks to increase food 
production worldwide while enhancing yield, efﬁciency, and 
environmental sustainability (Gawande et al., 2023). By utilizing 
automation, data analytics, and technological advancements, PA 
also referred to as smart farming or precision farming; symbolizes a 
paradigm shift in agricultural management. This multidisciplinary 
approach enables farmers make informed decisions, modify 
interventions, and maximize resource utilization based on real-
time data insights. 
In the ﬁeld of PA and crop production, accurate yield prediction 
plays a vital role in promoting social and economic stability, 
alongside enhancing food security (Karunathilake et al., 2023). By 
anticipating crop yields in advance of harvest, farmers could 
strategically plan and mitigate production risks. Accurate yield 
forecasting plays a crucial role in enhancing food waste reduction, 
improving operational efﬁciency, and promoting sustainable 
agriculture. This approach not only optimizes resources but also 
contributes to a more sustainable agricultural future. The pre­
harvest yield estimation ﬁgures assist farmers in making critical 
choices, such as ﬁguring out how much fertilizer to use. 
Furthermore, possible hazards such as insect infestation and 
drought occurrence can be recognized in advance so that the 
appropriate measures can be taken (Lobell et al., 2015). 
The potential to create yield prediction techniques that are more 
accurate grows along with the volume and availability of data. Thus,

using artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) with big data management 
approaches has been shown to be a successful strategy for handling 
this massive amount of data. AI’s capacity to process vast volumes of 
data has recently drawn signiﬁcant interest in precision agriculture 
(El Behairy et al., 2023). A useful technique that can improve crop 
production prediction based on several characteristics is machine 
learning (ML), a subﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence. Using datasets that 
have been taught using experience-based ﬁndings, machine learning 
may extract knowledge from them and ﬁnd patterns and correlations 
(Liakos et al., 2018). 
Research on utilizing AI and remote sensing for agricultural 
practices dates back to the early 1980s (Weiss et al., 2019). However, 
recently there has been a noticeable growth in the use of these 
methods and instruments for agricultural purposes. It is also 
essential to comprehend how these tools are used, which 
strategies are most frequently employed, and how assessments are 
carried out, particularly in order to direct future research and 
development. Thus, the present review aims to answer these 
queries. The present review presents a constructive overview of 
remote sensing and ML used in yield estimation and prediction. It 
not only highlights successful approaches but also identiﬁes 
important gaps and suggests areas for further research and 
development. This study highlights the signiﬁcance of combining 
various methods and factors to increase the precision and 
dependability of yield prediction models by examining the 
difﬁculties involved in data gathering and model construction. 
2 Deep learning techniques 
Deep learning is becoming a key technology in agriculture, 
effectively managing spatiotemporal data and automatically 
extracting important features without manual engineering (Tian 
et al., 2021). Deep learning algorithms have the potential to enhance 
decision-making by effectively uncovering hidden patterns in data, 
leading to more informed and useful decision rules. Several crop 
simulation models are widely recognized in the literature for their 
effectiveness in agricultural research and analysis. Notable examples 
include the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), 
Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES), World Food 
Studies Simulation Model (WOFOST), Decision Support System 
for Agriculture Technology Transfer (DSSAT), and AquaCrop 
(Jones, 2003; Capa-Morocho et al., 2016). These models provide 
valuable insights and support informed decision-making in 
agricultural practices. Crop model predictor factors outperformed 
meteorological variables in explaining production variability, 
according to a study that evaluated their capacity to replicate crop 
yield ﬂuctuations (Lecerf et al., 2019). 
The three  layers  of  a deep learning model  are usually  the input  
layer, the output layer, and the hidden/activation layer (Yang et al., 
2019). They pass the input through a deep neural network with several 
layers in order to produce predictions. Every layer examines the data to 
extract unique features at various resolutions or granularities, which are 
subsequently combined into more abstract features via a hierarchical 
procedure (Nguyen et al., 2019). Because deep learning technology can 
handle large datasets, learn intricate correlations between variables, and 
use nonlinear functions, its application in agriculture has accelerated 
(Tian et al., 2023). Deep learning has developed quickly with the advent 
of  the big  data  age and  improvements in graphics processing units 
(GPUs). Deep learning is a state-of-the-art technique with enormous 
promise for picture processing and data analysis. It has been 
successfully used in a variety of industries, including agriculture, and 
has yielded outstanding results.23 Deep learning is a useful tool in 
the ﬁeld of crop yield prediction since the accuracy of prediction 
results depends on the extraction of factors controlling crop growth 
(Tian et al., 2023). The particular application scenario, data quality, and 
model parameter choice all affect how various deep learning models 
estimate crop yield. Every architecture, starting with the ﬁrst deep 
neural networks (DNNs) and progressing to convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and their 
signiﬁcant variations like long short-term memory networks 
(LSTMs) and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), has proven to be 
highly effective in crop yield predictions. Russello (2018) predicted 
crop yield using a Convolutional Neural Network based on satellite 
images. Their model performed better than other machine learning 
techniques and used 3D convolutions to capture spatiotemporal data. 
Sharma et al. (2020) estimated wheat crops by combining CNNs 
and LSTMs. They conducted trials using a raw image collection and 
saw encouraging outcomes. With an accuracy of 74%, the suggested 
CNN-LSTM fusion method beat other convolutional techniques, and it 
also outperformed other deep learning models with 50% accuracy. 
In order to predict the corn yield, another study combined 
environmental elements like canopy surface temperature and water 
stress index with vegetation indices like the normalized vegetation 
index (NVDI) and Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation 
(APAR) (Table 1) (Wang et al., 2020). Fernandes et al (Fernandes 
et al., 2017). observed that the selection of vegetation indices affects 
agricultural yield. NDVIre, NDVI, and GNDVI all performed well for 
ﬁeld variability, according to their study on maize yield prediction. 
When compared to NDVI and GNDVI, Haghverdi et al. (2018) 
found that NDVIre was a more effective way to predict crop 
productivity. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of LSTM in 
agricultural yield prediction, de Freitas Cunha and Silva (2020)

predictions and ﬁeld mapping.

conducted thirty distinct train-test cycles. Since NDVI-based crop 
yield prediction is only possible at a speciﬁc plant growth stage, while 
weather-based prediction is possible prior to planting, their strategy 
was to use weather and soil data rather than satellite data. 
Additionally, Zhang et al. (2021) determined an appropriate VI for 
agricultural yield prediction and discovered that the combination of 
input data performs well for crop yield prediction. 
The complex nonlinear relationships between input and 
response variables are successfully revealed by deep neural 
networks, in contrast to shallow networks with only one hidden 
layer. They also eliminate the time-consuming manual feature-
crafting process (LeCun et al., 2015). For efﬁcient training, they 
require more advanced technology and optimization techniques. 
The network’s convergence may be hampered by issues like 
vanishing or inﬂating gradients, even if enhancing the hidden 
layers may reduce classiﬁcation or regression errors (He K et al., 
2016). In order to estimate agricultural yield, Sobhana et al. (2022) 
devised an approach that combines geographic data with deep 
neural networks. Along with developing a user interface known as 
CROPUP, they developed a recommendation engine that uses deep 
learning techniques like XGBoost to suggest appropriate crops. 
When used, their methodology can increase crop yield and 
efﬁciency, with an accuracy of 99.3% in all seasons (Sobhana 
et al., 2022). In order to predict the yield of hybrid maize, Khaki 
and Wang (2019) suggested a deep learning method for crop yield 
prediction. This method used a deep neural network based on 
environmental and genotype data. With an RMSE of 12.81 kg/1000 
m2 and a validation correlation coefﬁcient of 0.814,34 the results 
show that this model outperforms other popular techniques, such as 
regression trees (RT), shallow neural networks (SNN), and Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso). 
CNNs are more efﬁcient at locating important features in data 
than conventional feedforward neural networks. Crop mapping and 
yield prediction also make use of a 1D CNN applied along the 
temporal or spectral dimension. Multitemporal images can be 
effectively and efﬁciently classiﬁed using 1D CNN, as shown by 
Zhong et al. (2019) Using multitemporal Landsat EVI data, the 
authors classiﬁed summer crops by comparing the output of a 1D 
CNN and an RNN. The 1D CNN outperformed CNN-, RF-, and 
SVM-based techniques in the experiment in terms of accuracy and 
FI score. This experiment showed how 1D CNN may express 
temporal data for crop classiﬁcation. This method’s drawback is 
that it ignores the spectral and spatial information seen in satellite 
imagery. For crop mapping, Zhou et al. (2018) employed object-
based image analysis, a classiﬁcation technique that is widely known 
for high-resolution pictures. The authors created segments from 
Sentinel-2 data using a segmentation method, then classiﬁed the 
segments’ mean spectral vector using a 1D CNN. Although this 
method captured spatial information by using the mean of the 
segments, it failed to describe the time relation, which would have 
increased accuracy. 
Among the popular CNN variations for yield prediction are 2D­
CNN, 3D-CNN, and YOLO. In particular, 3D-CNN is known as a 
spatiotemporal method, whereas 2D-CNN is frequently referred to 
as a spatial approach (Khaki et al., 2020). Yang et al. created a corn 
yield prediction model using a 2D-CNN deep learning algorithm. 
According to the study, 2D-CNN offers notable beneﬁts in terms of 
feature extraction and categorization (Yang et al., 2021). Nevavuori 
et al. (2020) used time series and multi-temporal data in a spatial– 
temporal 3D-CNN architecture to forecast yield in the ﬁeld. The 
prediction accuracy of the 3D-CNN model was higher than that of 
the other models. Nevavuori et al. (2019) developed a crop yield 
forecast model for wheat and barley using Convolutional Neural 
Networks, which were based on Normalized Difference Vegetation 
Index (NDVI) and RGB (a color model used for representing and 
creating colors) data collected from drones. The ﬁnal results showed 
that the CNN model could provide a particular deep learning model 
for crops in Finland’s continental subarctic environment by 
estimating yields based on RGB photos in a reasonable and 
accurate manner. 
RNNs are useful for a variety of applications, such as time series 
analysis, handwriting recognition, picture captioning, machine 
translation, natural language processing, and crop yield prediction 
(Archana and Kumar, 2023). Nevertheless, RNNs have a problem 
with vanishing or ballooning gradients, which makes it difﬁcult to 
forecast long-term relationships. To overcome the vanishing 
gradient problem in RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
networks were created (Nevavuori et al., 2019). A rice yield 
prediction model was created by Wang et al. (2023) using an 
artiﬁcial neural network with Bidirectional Long Short-Term 
Memory (Bi-LSTM). With an average inaccuracy of 25 kg/m2, the 
results show that the Bi-LSTM prediction model does well in 
predicting rice production. 
3 Machine learning techniques 
The ability of machine learning algorithms to solve big non­
linear problems on their own using datasets from several (perhaps 
related) sources is one of their key beneﬁts. Ma et al. (2021) created 
a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)-based maize yield prediction 
model at the county level. This model forecasts maize yields in 
atypical years brought on by major weather events with accuracy, in 
addition to accurately estimating maize yields in regular years. The 
prediction results’ average R2 is 0.77, offering a strong foundation 
for projecting intra-seasonal crop yields. Ren et al. (2023) developed 
an innovative hybrid strategy that combines deep learning methods 
with the WOFOST model to enhance yield predictions. By using 
tailored feature combinations for each growth stage, they conducted 
a comprehensive analysis that achieved impressive results: a Mean 
Relative Error (MRE) of 1.5, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 
102.65 kg/ha, and an R-squared (R²) value of 0.98. This approach 
provides reliable analytical data for different growth phases and 
signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy of yield forecasting, beneﬁting 
agricultural planning and decision-making. Chu and Yu (2020) 
employed another model for crop yield prediction by combining 
Back-Propagation Neural Networks (BPNNs) and Independently 
Recurrent Neural Networks (IndRNN). 
Software libraries with pre-built structures designed for DL 
model implementation are known as deep-learning frameworks. In 
Frontiers in Agronomy 
04 
frontiersin.org 
Saha et al. 
10.3389/fagro.2025.1566201 
this approach, DL architectures have become easier to implement 
and more accessible. Convolutional architectures for PyTorch 
(Paszke et al., 2019), CNTK (Seide and Agarwal, 2016), and 
MatConvNet (Vedaldi and Lenc, 2015) are the most widely used 
DL frameworks. With the help of these frameworks’ powerful GPU 
backend, networks with billions of parameters can be trained. A 
machine learning library called Scikit-learn (2022) also incorporates 
deep neural networks. 
To further expand the data and make sure the model was 
independent of rotation and ﬂips, data-augmentation techniques 
like rotation and ﬂips were also included in the crop-mapping 
(Du et al., 2019) and yield-prediction investigations. To overcome 
the lack of training data, a few crop-mapping research employed 
weakly supervised learning and the domain-adaptation technique 
(Wang et al., 2020). Therefore, further reﬁnement of deep learning 
model architectures and algorithms will be essential developments 
in agricultural production forecasting. 
4 Remote sensing techniques 
Remote sensing photographs provide timely, consistent, and 
cost-effective data for identifying and tracking the features of the 
earth’s surface (Justice et al., 2002). Geological reconnaissance, 
environmental monitoring, and agricultural productivity are just a 
few key sectors where this technology proves invaluable. 
Predicting agricultural yields before harvest is crucial for planning 
and deciding on different policies. Conventional approaches are 
expensive, subjective, and time-consuming. A number of issues also 
inﬂuence the development of empirical models that use meteorological 
data. Information on electromagnetic radiation was gathered using a 
wide variety of sensors, including satellite images, aerial 
photogrammetry, multispectral scanners in the air, high and low 
spectral and spatial resolution, and ﬁeld-based spectrometer analysis 
(Jennewein et al., 2024). Two types of ﬂuorescence are employed to 
evaluate the physiological conditions of vegetation cover and stress 
levels (Belasque et al., 2008). Between 400 and 600 nm is the 
wavelength for blue-green ﬂuorescence, while between 650 and 800 
nm is the wavelength for chlorophyll ﬂuorescence. They also found that 
spectroscopic analysis can be utilized to evaluate in-plant diseases, 
environmental stress levels, and nutritional deﬁciencies. 
Important characteristics that are used in a variety of 
agricultural applications are vegetation indices (VIs). For instance, 
there are various uses for the normalized difference vegetation index 
(NDVI) in crop monitoring (Karmakar et al., 2024). Leaf nitrogen 
content can be estimated with the aid of the Angular Insensitivity 
Vegetation Index (AIVI) (He et al., 2016). The Photochemical 
Reﬂectance Index (PRI) can be used to analyze the severity of 
plant diseases (Huang et al., 2008). Using linear non-linear 
procedures, VIs are produced by combining remotely sensed data 
at various wavelengths, usually in the red and infrared ranges 
(Bhunia et al., 2021). In order to enhance early warning systems, 
these measures have been used to evaluate crop growth status and 
the effects of agroclimatic conditions, pests and diseases, water 
stress, and management techniques on crop development. 
4.1 Field sensors 
The electromagnetic spectrum includes several key wavelengths 
that are particularly effective for ﬂuorescence imaging. These 
include the green (520–550 nm), blue (440 nm), red (690 nm), 
far-red (740 nm), and near-infrared (800 nm) regions. Utilizing 
these speciﬁc wavelengths can enhance the effectiveness of 
ﬂuorescence imaging techniques (Coops et al., 2003). Lenk et al. 
(2007) demonstrated the use of multispectral data and applications 
to improve imaging techniques by discriminating fruit quality, 
photosynthetic activities, tissue structures, and plant disease 
symptoms. These techniques are an overview since they provide 
three-dimensional spectral information in the form of pictures and 
incorporate spectral characteristics from multiple areas. 
The use of hyperspectral images in precision farming 
applications has grown signiﬁcantly. According to Zaman et al. 
(2011) remote sensing data provides an easy and affordable way to 
differentiate between different land uses, such as horticultural crops 
or orchards, and fruit trees. By evaluating the landscape’s intricate 
monitoring characteristics, multi-temporal satellite imaging data 
offer a means of identifying notable changes in land cover and 
measuring the rates of change. The phases of crop growth and 
agricultural phenology were not clearly deﬁned and are often hard 
to explain because of variations in crop varieties, plant densities, 
and crop cultivation techniques. 
However, using spectral derivatives, continuous removal 
transformations, and continuous wavelet transformations, 
hyperspectral data are more sophisticated in detecting leaf 
biochemical constituents or recognizing aberrant spectral features 
impacted by pests and diseases. When leaf characteristics like 
pigment concentration, other chemical components, or pest or 
disease problems vary, the scattering from the leaf reacts 
differently at different wavelengths (Knyazikhin et al., 2013). In 
addition to the PRI for identifying wheat yellow rust (Huang et al., 
2007) and the chlorophyll absorption ratio index (CARI) for 
identifying wheat  powdery mildew (Zhang et al., 2012), a 
blueshift was noted in the red-edge peak in the ﬁrst derivative of 
rice plant spectral curves afﬂicted by rice leaf folder (Huang et al., 
2012). However, the implementation of satellite hyperspectral 
sensors in operational activities is not practical due to their 
limited swaths and low temporal resolution. As a result, 
operational crop monitoring rarely includes the detection of 
nitrogen stress or the identiﬁcation of crop diseases and pests. 
4.2 Satellite imagery 
At the regional and local levels, agricultural production has 
been evaluated and estimated using satellite data from Landsat, 
SPOT, WorldView, and Sentinel-2, which have a medium spatial 
resolution ranging from 10 to 100 meters (Mueller et al., 2012). 
Crop yields and biomass have been assessed using images from 
Landsat 5 TM and SPOT 4 (Noureldin et al., 2013). The issue of 
small areas was resolved and excellent crop yield accuracy was 
established using Quickbird, SPOT5, and Landsat satellite photos 
Frontiers in Agronomy

Saha et al. 
10.3389/fagro.2025.1566201 
(Yang et al., 2009). Patel et al. (1991) established an empirical 
correlation to estimate agricultural output using the ratio of NIR 
and R spectral bands generated from IRS LISS data. Shirsath et al. 
(2020) created crop yield maps after conducting a regional study on 
crop yield using the Enhanced Vegetation Index obtained from 
MODIES data. 
4.3 Aerial photography 
Airborne multispectral sensors generate high-resolution images 
that feature accurate spatial resolutions and a wide range of spectral 
bands. Recent studies by Torresan et al. (2016) and Manfreda et al. 
(2018) highlight the growing recognition within the ecological 
research community of aerial photography using Unmanned 
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This innovative technology is proving to 
be an invaluable tool for effectively monitoring vegetation and 
ecosystems, opening up new possibilities for ecological 
assessments and management. 
It is possible to quantify spectral reﬂectance in the lab as well as 
in the ﬁeld. To evaluate crop production, a range of ground optical 
sensors, including spectrometers and high resolution hyperspectral 
digital multispectral sensors, have been developed to gather 
reﬂectance data in different spectrum regions (Ahamed et al., 
2011). Numerous spectral bands collected spanning the 
electromagnetic spectrum (350–2500 nm) are available using ﬁeld 
spectroscopy, a form of ground-based remote sensing (Numata 
et al., 2008). Spectroscopic data at the ground and leaf level in the 
visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum are 
supported by the notion that light interacts with the plant and that a 
green leaf’s reﬂectance properties play a role. Multidate optical 
(visible and near-infrared) remote sensing data and multidate 
microwave SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite data are 
utilized for wheat and other crops (Defourny et al., 2019). Crop 
residues and intercrops can be identiﬁed using SAR time-series. 
Additionally, it can be used to ﬁnd crop residues and intercrops. 
In a recent study, crop management is improved to attain the 
best possible production in terms of both quantity and quality by 
using remote sensing to display the spatial variance in crop growth 
of wheat (Rebouh et al., 2023b). In 2019, Sentinel-2, which has a 10 
m resolution, was utilized to track changes in wheat growth under 
various management techniques and the ﬁndings demonstrated 
that Green Chlorophyll Index performs best in forecasting 
crop yield. 
5 Crop yield prediction study using 
performance evaluation metrics 
An important part of estimating is comparing model outputs to 
real data. In order to effectively evaluate model performance and 
distinguish between various learning models, it is important to 
utilize appropriate evaluation metrics (Elavarasan et al., 2020). Key 
performance indicators for regression models, such as the 
coefﬁcient of determination (R-squared), mean absolute error 
(MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error 
(RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), play a 
vital role in providing a comprehensive assessment of a model’s 
accuracy and reliability. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) serves as 
a valuable tool for measuring the average signiﬁcance of errors in a 
set of forecasts, as it calculates the arithmetic mean of the absolute 
differences between predicted and actual observations (Ali et al., 
2018). Similarly, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) provides insights 
into the performance of the estimator by assessing how closely the 
regression line aligns with the data points (Elavarasan et al., 2020). 
To enhance the evaluation of model performance and facilitate 
meaningful comparisons between different learning models, it is 
crucial to utilize a range of evaluation metrics. Important 
performance indicators for regression models include the 
coefﬁcient of determination (R-squared), Mean Absolute Error 
(MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error 
(RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). 
The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) provides valuable insight 
into the standard deviation of the residuals, illustrating how closely 
the data points align with the best ﬁt line (Chakrabarty et al., 2021). 
This helps pinpoint areas for improvement in our model. 
Furthermore, the Coefﬁcient of Determination (R-squared) offers 
a clear measure of how well our regression model captures the data, 
demonstrating that developed framework outperforms the baseline 
framework (Pant et al., 2021). Lastly, the Mean Absolute Percentage 
Error (MAPE) allows us to calculate the average percentage errors, 
showcasing the degree to which the forecasts differ from actual 
outcomes (Elavarasan et al., 2020). For classiﬁcation difﬁculties, 
classiﬁcation accuracy is still the most popular and useful metric. 
6 Challenges and limitations 
6.1 Geographical limitations 
We must consider geographic differences because farming 
practices, climate, and crop types vary by location. When 
forecasting crops for different regions or countries, it’s essential to 
combine data and recognize these differences. Collecting accurate 
data on crop growth, soil, and climate can be challenging. High-
quality data is crucial for deep learning, but issues like noise, 
missing information, or poor quality can reduce the model’s 
effectiveness. Soil nutrients, pests, diseases, and climate impact 
crop yields, but their complex interactions complicate accurate 
predictions (Figure 2).  Climate change and  natural disasters  
create uncertainty, making long-term projections difﬁcult. 
Current models often overlook key factors and have limitations 
that need improvement. 
6.2 Scalability and accessibility of 
technology 
Deep learning (DL) models can be highly effective for crop 
prediction, but they often require signiﬁcant training time,

especially with multiple layers. Performance may vary, and the most 
complex models do not always yield the best user experience. To 
select the right crop prediction model, it’s important to analyze data 
conditions, prediction needs, and model characteristics. Comparing 
and evaluating different models will help identify the best ﬁt. 
Additionally, consider factors like interpretability, computational 
efﬁciency, data requirements, and practical application to enhance 
your selection process. The difﬁculty lies in ﬁguring out how to 
make the working model more accurate by training it on a larger 
dataset, evaluating it to see how well it performs, and ﬁguring out 
how micro-topological changes impact crop yield prediction 
(Bramon et al., 2011). Examining the model’s substantial practical 
implications for giving farmers, growers, and policymakers accurate 
information on crop yield presents another difﬁculty. 
Advancements in agricultural production prediction are poised to 
transform the industry through the ongoing reﬁnement of deep 
learning models and algorithms. By leveraging big data to analyze 
soil, climate, and plant growth, these models will reveal valuable 
insights and patterns, enhancing crop yield management and 
forecasting accuracy. With added layers, complex connectivity, and 
strategic parameter tuning, these models will effectively grasp intricate 
data relationships. This empowers farmers to maximize yields while 
minimizing resource use. Ultimately, improvements in predictive 
modeling will boost the sustainability of agriculture, addressing 
global food security challenges and paving the way for innovative 
advancements in agricultural forecasting (Gamage et al., 2024). 
Satellite data remains a highly effective method for surveying 
extensive areas and monitoring agricultural changes on both regional 
and national scales. By leveraging satellite imagery, we can gain 
valuable insights for practical applications. However, it’s essential to 
have a strong foundation in technical knowledge and skills to 
effectively process this data and maximize its potential beneﬁts. To 
extract relevant information for agricultural monitoring, the vast 
amount of data from many sensors necessitates effective processing 
and analysis techniques (Wu et al., 2022). Due to variations in 
spectral range, data format, and geographical and temporal 
resolution, integrating data from many sensors can be difﬁcult. 
This may result in challenges with data fusion and processing, 
which may impact crop monitoring’s precision and dependability 
(Joshi et al., 2023). A number of variables, including sensor 
calibration, atmospheric conditions, and data processing 
techniques, can affect the consistency and quality of remote sensing 
data from various sources. Additionally, this may make data fusion 
and analysis challenging (Omia et al., 2023). Furthermore, the 
Frontiers in Agronomy

Saha et al. 
10.3389/fagro.2025.1566201 
difﬁculty is in creating a strategy with possible variables that will 
probably work well for all crops or certain crop types. 
6.3 Data privacy and security concerns 
Another big obstacle farmers face is negotiating proper data 
rights in agriculture with Agriculture Technology Providers (ATPs). 
It implies that to ensure a long-lasting and mutually beneﬁcial 
partnership between farmers and ATPs, procedures for calculating 
rewards, protecting rights, and conducting audits are necessary (Yu 
et al., 2025). Clearer laws, farmers’ involvement in contract talks, 
and the creation of marketplaces for digital commodities like data 
and products derived from it are some possible remedies. It does, 
however, recognize that these solutions are intricate and that their 
success depends on stakeholder cooperation, regulation, and 
education (Bryan and Richey, 2020). Concerns about data 
ownership, sharing, and access rights must be addressed by 
farmers and IT companies in order to safeguard sensitive data, 
foster trust, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations 
(Shawe and McAndrew, 2023). 
6.4 Energy efﬁciency concerns 
Big data, however, necessitates datacenters with upgraded 
infrastructure that can handle and analyze data with greater 
responsibility. A key consideration in the planning and 
construction of contemporary datacenters is power usage. The 
overall power used by computing systems is barely declining, 
despite a continuous increase in the performance per watt ratio 
(Al-Fares et al., 2008). Greenhouse gas emissions from this have a 
signiﬁcant effect on the environment as well. Therefore, reducing 
energy use and operating expenses is a critical consideration as the 
datacenter’s size grows. The servers, storage, and connective 
network infrastructure of future datacenters should be able to 
manage big data applications with minimal energy consumption. 
6.5 New developments and possible 
inventions 
In order to enhance overall performance, more models, frames, 
or intricate structures are anticipated to take use of the spectral and 
temporal dimensions of satellite data and combine additional 
elements that have been extracted using different techniques. 
Therefore, the application of both spatial (such as ﬁeld-measured 
data) and historical (such as crop rotation histories) data to deep 
learning methods, along with the incorporation of multisensor data, 
satellite-derived crop phenology, and cropping practice information 
(Adrian et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021), constitute signiﬁcant future 
directions that can result in cloud services to ensure globally 
accurate crop mapping and area estimation results (Kussul et al., 
2017). To enhance learning performance and reduce dependence on 
in situ data, it is essential to further develop transfer learning 
techniques. These techniques integrate crop phenology with 
existing knowledge of agricultural practices. By using a model 
that has been pretrained on a large dataset, we can more 
effectively adapt it to improve prediction accuracy for the speciﬁc 
target dataset. The geographical resolution and fragmentation of the 
agricultural environment determine resolution bias, which is 
inevitable (Waldner and Defourny, 2017). Resolution bias can 
arise from pixels covering small ponds, canals, and other noncrop 
objects, especially in mountainous regions. Therefore, by assessing 
the effects of the combination of arable land pixels, an unbiased 
estimator must be used to adapt the actual crop area in a given 
location (Olofsson et al., 2014). 
7 Conclusions 
Crop yield and agricultural output can be signiﬁcantly 
enhanced by addressing several key factors. These include 
optimizing climate conditions, improving soil properties, ensuring 
proper crop nutrient management, and maximizing crop canopy 
volume and biomass. Additionally, maintaining adequate water 
content while effectively managing diseases, weeds, and insects, as 
well as selecting the right crop cultivars and varieties, can further 
contribute to successful agricultural production. According to the 
current review, deep learning models typically produce predictions 
that are more accurate than those made by conventional machine 
learning models. But it’s also critical to test models with different 
feature counts and levels of complexity in order to identify the top-
performing model. Lastly, we also discussed about the possible 
challenges in estimating agricultural yields using these technologies. 
Additionally, a fast, cost-effective, and efﬁcient way to track and 
evaluate crop vigor and estimate crop production is using remote 
sensing. A highly effective and realistic approach to yield prediction 
could involve employing direct statistical and empirical models that 
utilize minimal inputs. By integrating data collected from remote 
sensing sensors with measured factors that reﬂect the biochemical 
and biophysical properties of crops, we can enhance the input 
components of these models. This method has the potential to 
improve prediction accuracy and efﬁciency in yield forecasting. 
While satellite data and processing capabilities are now advanced, 
many organizations and agencies still use satellite-derived crop 
monitoring methods to inform policymakers about crop production 
and food security issues. Prediction accuracy is measured by 
common performance metrics such as RMSE, MSE, MAE, and 
MAPE. However, these approaches have not yet achieved near-real­
time, accurate, and quantitative information about crops. 
Furthermore, concentrating on modeling prediction uncertainty 
can help with efﬁcient estimation of prediction result uncertainty, 
enhancing the predictability and interpretability of forecasts.
