Rice followed by wheat is the dominant cropping system in the middle Indo-
Gangetic plains (IGP). Lower productivity (4.8  t ha−1) of this cropping system in 
Bihar, compared to the national average (6.8  t  ha−1) due to several climate- 
and production-related issues, is a matter of concern for the farmers and the 
policymakers. Keeping all these in view, an experiment with rice–wheat cropping 
system was carried out during 2020–21 and 2021–22 in 17 adopted villages of 13 
districts of Bihar under the Project “Climate Resilient Agriculture Program (CRAP)”

to evaluate the feasibility of early transplanting of rice in the month of June with 
the aim of achieving higher system productivity by early harvesting of rice and 
subsequent timely sowing of wheat before 15 November with the provision of 
assured irrigation. In this study, the concept of an innovative community irrigation 
approach and single-phase 3-hp submersible pump was employed. Long-
duration rice variety (150 days) Rajendra Mahsuri-1 was sown during 20–25 May in 
the nursery and transplanted through puddling operation during 15–20 June in 17 
locations. Under delayed conditions, the nursery sowing and transplanting window 
were 10–15 June and 10–15 July, respectively. Timely sown rice grown with the 
provision of a community irrigation system achieved a grain yield of 5.2  t  ha−1 and 
85.8% higher water productivity, compared to late-sown crops. Following the 
harvest of rice, the HD-2967 variety of wheat was planted in the first fortnight 
of November and harvested in the first week of April, yielding 4.9 t  ha−1 with the 
application of 2–3 irrigations based on soil type and evaporative demand. Timely 
harvesting of wheat facilitated farmers of the region to take an additional crop of 
summer green gram. With an assured irrigation system and shifting planting dates 
and thereby managing climatic risks, the overall productivity of the rice–wheat 
cropping system was achieved to the tune of 10.1 t  ha−1 with a cropping intensity 
of 300% for better adaptation and sustainable production.

1 Introduction
Rice–wheat cropping system (RWCS) is the most prevalent 
agricultural production system covering nearly 14 million hectares in 
the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of South Asia (Alam et al., 2016), of 
which 10 million hectares lies in India alone. This cropping system is 
predominantly followed in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, Uttar 
Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh contributing around 75% of the 
national food grain production. However, the sustainability of RWCS 
in India is facing severe challenges mainly due to resource paucity (Jat 
et al., 2018; Mondal et al., 2020), water scarcity (Bhatt et al., 2016), and 
climatic variability (Jain et al., 2014). In the state of Bihar located in 
the middle IGP, the major food demand is met through RWCS, which 
contributes about 77.4% of the total food grain production from 
around 70% of the gross cropped area, but the productivity of both 
crops is very low due to the frequent occurrence of climatic stresses 
such as abnormal temperature, erratic rainfall, increased frequency 
and duration of dry spells, and early withdrawal and erratic nature of 
monsoon, which adversely affects the production potential and food 
security (Lal, 2019; Arunrat et al., 2020). The mean productivity of rice 
in Bihar stands at 2.5 t ha−1, that too, with a decreasing compound 
agricultural growth rate of (−) 3.61% in 2017–2018, as compared to 
2014–2015 (Economic Survey of Bihar, 2019–2020).
In Bihar such as in all other states of eastern India, the major 
constraint in getting the potential yield of rice is late transplanting 
(Sattar et al., 2017) due to delays in obtaining water for puddling 
operations following the late onset of monsoon on many occasions 
and the lack of irrigation facility at an affordable rate. There should 
be ponded water in the initial stage of transplanting for the smooth 
recovery of plants. For ensuring timely sowing and transplanting of 
rice, the major source of irrigation is groundwater, which is extracted 
by a diesel pump set. The diesel pump sets have centrifugal pumps, 
and they are not able to extract groundwater during peak hours in 
summer when the water table goes down and there is a great rush for 
transplanting. Diesel pump sets have high diesel consumption with 
comparatively lesser water discharge and higher greenhouse gas 
emission. In view of this, the government recently started electrifying 
the irrigation system with the installation of three-phase 5/7.5 hp. 
diesel pumps. These pumps operated by the farmers do not perform 
well as it requires a constant supply of electricity in all three phases. 
Moreover, the electricity consumption is almost 5 times per hour, 
compared to a 3-hp single-phase tube well. Accordingly, it requires an 
investment of significant funds. Considering the cost of irrigation, it 
is around INR 6000.00 per hectare for a diesel pump set, INR 3000.00 
per hectare for a three-phase electrified irrigation system, and INR 
300.00 per hectare for a 3-hp single-phase pump set. Hence, the high 
cost of irrigation coupled with the late onset of monsoon is also a 
major factor that compels the farmers of the region for late 
transplanting of rice. Consequently, late transplanting tends to 
significantly impact the occurrence of critical phenological stages of 
the crop. Under delayed transplanting, the flowering of the crop 
coincides with the prevalence of low temperatures beyond September. 
Under such a situation, there is a greater possibility that a large 
percentage of chaffy grains would be produced. Not only this but also 
the delay in transplanting affects the sowing of succeeding wheat 
crops. In this region, when wheat is sown beyond November, the 
problem of terminal heat stress during the flowering to the milking 
stage of the crop arises in most of the years and consequently, it affects 
grain setting and wheat productivity significantly. About 80% of wheat 
sowing is delayed in the region beyond the period of 25 November, 
forcing the crop to encounter higher temperatures (terminal heat) 
during the growing season (end of February to March) (Sattar et al., 
2023). Therefore, terminal heat stress associated with dry westerly 
wind is a serious climatic constraint for successful wheat cultivation

in India, particularly when it occurs during the grain-filling stage 
(Sandhu et al., 2016; Sattar et al., 2020). In one study on wheat, Poudel 
et  al. (2021) observed that the optimum temperature during the 
anthesis and grain-filling stage ranges from 12 to 22°C. As evident, 
among all the weather factors, temperature plays a crucial role in 
determining the sowing time and consequently the duration of 
different phenophases, which ultimately affect crop productivity. 
Moreover, when the farmers go for delayed sowing (beyond 25 
November), there is always a greater chance that the crop will face the 
fury of a hailstorm during the ripening and harvesting stage in the 
month of April as the region experiences a greater probability (>70%) 
of hailstorms during this month.
Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) provides an opportunity to 
analyze the livelihood issues of the farmers and helps scientists to 
understand the problems. It is an important tool to identify the 
location-specific researchable issues and find out possible short- and 
long-term benefits. Kumari et al. (2019) used the PRA tool in some 
districts of Bihar to develop problem-solution tree of the issues faced 
by the farmers. The climatic issues affecting rice–wheat production in 
the region were reported by Srivastava et al. (2018). In the present 
study, the PRA tool was used to address the problems faced by the 
farmers of rice–wheat cropping system, and based on this, villages in 
different districts were selected for this study.
Considering the above facts, the present study was undertaken to 
evaluate the feasibility of early transplanting of rice through an assured 
irrigation system and its impact on phenology, yield, and yield 
attributes. Early transplanting of rice ensured its early harvesting and 
timely sowing of subsequent wheat crops. Accordingly, the yield 
potential of RWCS by advancing planting dates and water productivity 
of rice under timely and late transplanted conditions were evaluated 
by employing an innovative approach through the Climate Resilient 
Agriculture (CRA) Program for higher system productivity, better 
adaptation, and sustainability under changing climatic scenarios. The 
innovation in this case refers to the early transplanting of rice through 
assured community irrigation by a 3-hp single-phase tube well.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Study area
Bihar is located in the middle Gangetic Plains of India. The study 
was conducted in 17 different adopted villages of different Farm 
Science Centres (Popularly known as Krishi Vigyan Kendras, KVKs) 
of Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Pusa, namely, 
(1) Sukhet (Madhubani), (2) Jale (Darbhanga), (3) Manjhi (Saran), (4) 
Bhagwanpur Hat (Siwan), (5) Sipaya (Gopalganj), (6) Sheohar, (7) 
Sitamarhi, (8) Madhopur (West Champaran), (9) Narkatiaganj (West 
Champaran), (10) Parsauni (East Champaran), (11) Piprakothi (East 
Champaran), (12) Lada (Samastipur), (13) Birauli (Samastipur), (14) 
Vaishali, (15) Turki (Muzaffarpur), (16) Saraiya (Muzaffarpur), and 
(17) Khodabanpur (Begusarai), under the Project “Climate Resilient 
Agriculture (CRA) Program” funded by the Government of Bihar, 
India, during kharif seasons of 2020 and 2021, rabi seasons of 2020–
2021 and 2021–2022, and summer seasons of 2021 and 2022. The 
location of the study area is given in Figure 1. The depth of the water 
table in the study area varies from 2 to 5 m below ground level 
(Anon, 2022).
2.2 Climate, soil, and cropping system
The region has a sub-humid subtropical monsoon climate. About 
85% of the annual rainfall occurs during the monsoon season. 
Considering the cropping season, it is known as kharif season, during 
which rice crop is grown. The region experiences four seasons, viz., 
Summer (March–May), Monsoon (June–September), Post-Monsoon 
(October–November), and Winter (December–February). The 
average annual rainfall of the region ranges from 1,230 to 1,400 mm. 
The month-wise rainfall distribution pattern is given in Figure 2. May 
is the warmest summer month of the year with a daily maximum 
temperature of 37–41°C, while the coldest winter month is January 
with a daily minimum temperature of 5–8°C in January (Bal et al., 
2023). Although December, January, and February are the main 
winter months, temperature decreases significantly from November. 
The average temperature falls appreciably from 26.9°C in October to 
21.9°C in November.
Soils of the study area are mainly young alluvium, calcareous, and 
predominantly sandy loam to loamy in texture. Soils are deep having 
calcium carbonate more than 10%. The water holding capacity varies 
from moderate to high. It has moderate drainage behavior. There is a 
wide variation in the nitrogen and available potassium status of these 
soils. Soil pH varies from 6.5 to 8.4. Rice–wheat is the major cropping 
system of the region and comprises about 60% of all crops and 
cropping sequences followed by the farmers (Kumari et al., 2022).
2.3 Methodology
2.3.1 Field criteria adopted for the study
The villages were selected through the Participatory Rural 
Appraisal Survey. In this region, late sowing and transplanting of rice 
are a usual practice due to the lack of affordable irrigation facilities and 
farmers’ dependency on monsoon rains both for transplanting and for 
meeting further irrigation requirements during its growing period 
(Najmuddin et al., 2018). While selecting the villages, it was kept in 
mind that wheat sowing gets delayed in the area due to late harvesting 
of paddy, thus forcing the crop to be affected by terminal heat stress. 
In addition, another criterion was that the successive green gram crop 
was either non-productive or non-remunerative due to the late 
harvesting of wheat in these villages. In case of late harvesting of wheat 
following late planting, subsequent summer green gram is affected on 
many occasions due to the initial burst of pre-monsoon showers and 
monsoon rains, leading to crop damage. An area of 15 acres was 
selected in each of 17 villages, and one 4-inch tube well fitted with a 
3-hp single-phase submersible pump was installed with a discharge 
capacity of 7–9 lps and irrigation command capacity of 15–20 acres 
each costing around 1.6 lakhs. While comparing the cost with a 15-hp 
three-phase tube well, it comes to around 17 lakhs per tube well. 
Moreover, these pumps do not perform well due to voltage 
fluctuations. It has a higher discharge rate as compared to the water 
demand of crops, it causes losses in irrigation water, and consequently, 
low water use efficiency is observed when compared with a 3-hp 
single-phase tube well. A group of 10–20 farmers from each village 
was formed with an agreement that all participating farmers will have 
an equal right and equal opportunity to avail irrigation facility as and 
when needed by the crop. One rural youth of the same adopted village 
was given the task of scheduling irrigation with a nominal cost of INR 
Jha et al.

15 per hour. The amount, thus collected, was deposited in a revolving 
account for future management of the tube wells, operational cost, and 
honorarium for the youth facilitator.
Long-duration high-yielding rice variety (Rajendra Mahsuri-1) of 
150-day duration was sown on 20–25 May in the nursery and 
transplanted on 15–20 June after puddling. In total, 2–3 irrigations 
were applied to the crop to maintain soil moisture above field capacity. 
Scheduling of irrigation was based on the disappearance of standing 
water from the crop field, and it was ensured that cracking in the rice 
field does not develop. The same variety of rice was sown during 
10–15 June in the nursery and transplanted during 10–15 July, which 
is generally practiced by the farmers near the experimental plots. After 
the harvest of paddy, HD-2967 variety of wheat was sown on 7 
November, and 2–3 irrigations were provided as per soil type and 
physiological demand of the crop. The same variety of wheat was sown 
during 25–30 November (regarded as delayed sowing) after the

harvest of paddy crops during 15–20 November. The third crop of 
green gram was sown on 10 and 25 April, respectively, at different 
locations. All the agronomic parameters and yield attributing 
characters were studied, recorded, and analyzed.
Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were applied to the rice 
crop in the ratio of 120:60:40. During the growing period of the crop, 
50% of nitrogen and full doses of phosphorus and potassium were 
used as basal application. The remaining nitrogen was applied in two 
equal splits: one at tillering and another at the panicle initiation stage. 
For weed management, two hand weedings were done at 30 and 
60 days after transplanting. In the case of wheat, nitrogen, phosphorus, 
and potassium at 120, 60, and 40 kg ha−1 were applied. All the 
phosphorus and potassium and half dose of nitrogen were applied at 
sowing as basal dose. The remaining half dose of nitrogen was top 
dressed in two equal splits at crown root initiation and boot stages.
2.3.2 Calculation of water productivity
Crop water productivity, irrigation water productivity, and 
effective rainfall were calculated using standard methodologies. 
Renfro equation as quoted by Chow (1964) has been employed in this 
study to work out effective rainfall as follows:
	
Re = (
) +
∗
E Rg
A
where Re is effective rainfall, Rg is growing season rainfall, A is 
average irrigation application, and E is the ratio of consumptive use of 
water (CU) to rainfall during the growing season.
The water productivity of rice was determined as the grain yield 
obtained per unit of rainfall plus irrigation water applied (Chahal 
et al., 2007).
2.3.3 Detection of change in rainfall pattern
As mentioned earlier, 17 locations were selected for the study. To 
detect the change in rainfall pattern over the study area, the daily rainfall 
of four stations (located in the study area) based on the availability of data 
for a period of 1990–2019 was analyzed. These stations are, viz., Pusa 
(25.98°N, 85.67°E; Samastipur district), Muzaffarpur (26.07°N, 85.24°E; 
Muzaffarpur district), Motihari (26.65°N, 84.91°E, East Champaran 
district), and Chhapra (25.78°N, 84.73°E, Saran district). Two sets of data, 
viz., 1990–2019 and 2010–2019, were considered to detect the changes in 
mean values of annual rainfall and rainy days, and number of dry days 
during monsoon. Trends and significance of these parameters were 
determined based on the Mann-Kendall Test (Mann, 1945; Kendall, 1975; 
Yadav et al., 2014), which is a function of the ranks of the observations 
rather than their actual values (Oguntunde et al., 2011). The test is 
non-parametric for identifying trends and is not affected by the actual 
distribution of the data and is less sensitive to outliers. Trends of 
maximum and minimum temperature during different months of the 
wheat growing season were also worked out.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Effect of preponing sowing dates on 
yield attributes and yield of rice
The grain yield of rice sown during 20–25 May with assured 
irrigation was found to be 5.2 t ha−1, whereas the yield obtained for 
10–15 June sown rice with farmers’ practice was 3.2 t ha−1, which was 
62.5% higher over the later sown crop (Table 1). This quantum jump 
was only because of higher physiological maturity days of the timely 
sown crop and the availability of proper moisture regimes in the rice 
field, fed through assured irrigation. In the late-sown crops, the 
growth period was short that ultimately limited the leaf surface area, 
panicle length, and number of grains per panicle, probably due to 
limited moisture in the field during dry spells, as this crop was not 
scientifically managed by the farmers. Delayed sowing had a bearing 
on the seed-setting rate. Ahmed et al. (2011) while working on rice 
observed that the 1,000-grain weight and the seed-setting rate 
decreased beyond the temperature of 27.0°C. Considering the 1,000-
grain weight, it was found to be 6.4% higher in the case of early sown 
crops (23.0 g) as compared to late-sown crops (21.6 g). Quite contrary 
to this, the number of unfilled tillers per m2 was found to be 5.8% 
higher in late-sown crops (24.3), compared to early sown crops (22.9). 
The critical temperature for inducing spikelet sterility in rice varied 
from 10 to 15°C (Tinarelli, 1989). Alvarado (2002) found that the 
average temperature under 20°C for 5 days during flowering stage 
increased the probability of obtaining spikelet sterility greater than 
10–12%. The total biological yield (including both grains and straw) 
was found to be 52.3% higher in early sown crops (12.18 t ha−1) as 
compared to late-sown crops (8.0 t ha−1) with harvest index of 42.8 and 
39.8%, respectively. Harvest index refers to quantify the grain yield 
versus total amount of biological yield that a crop produces, signifying 
the reproductive efficiency of the crop.
Early sown crops of rice recorded a 19.9% higher number of tillers 
(245.4 per m2) in comparison with the late-sown crops (204.8 per m2) 
(Table 2 and Figures 3, 4), which might be ascribed to the fact that 
younger age (21 days) of the seedlings with higher tillering capacity 
contributed to this increase. The old aged seedlings, of 30 days or more 
duration, as in the case of late transplanted rice might have produced 
a lesser number of tillers, probably some of its early vigor and tiller-
bearing capacity got exhausted in the nursery itself because of its age. 
The aged seedlings as transplanted for late-sown crops might have 
experienced greater uprooting and transplanting shocks, prompting 
the crop to remain at an initial slow rate of growth. The number of 
panicles per m2 and number of grains per panicle in early sown rice 
were found to be 23.4 and 24.5% higher (222.5 and 142.2, respectively), 
compared to late transplanted crops (180.5 and 114.3, respectively). 
The number of empty spikelets increased with shading and low 
temperature, and a decrease in filled grain percentage was observed 
due to the lower solar radiation. In long-duration varieties, low light 
stress synchronizing with the vegetative lag phase resulted in 
considerable tiller mortality and fewer productive panicles per square 
meter (Murty et  al., 1975). The reasons for higher yield, higher 
number of tillers per m2, higher number of panicles per m2, and 
number of grains per panicle might be due to congenial thermal and 
as well field moisture balance in the timely sown crop than the crops 
conventionally raised by the farmers. Moisture stress after 10 days of 
50% flowering significantly reduced single panicle weight, test weight, 
fertile spikelets per panicle, and total spikelets per panicle and 
significantly increased sterile spikelets per panicle.
Weather data presented in Figure 2 revealed that there was hardly 
any variation in actual and normal rainfall during May. However, June 
and July experienced deficit rainfall. Under such a water-stressed 
environment, the resource-poor farmers and the farmers with limited 
or no provision of irrigation sowed rice during 10–15 June in the 
nursery and transplanted during 10–15 July in the main field. The

experiment revealed that in the late transplanted rice as in the case of 
farmers’ practice, the days taken to attain 50% flowering decreased 
substantially as compared to early sown crops. The 15–20 June 
transplanted rice took 91 days to attain 50% flowering and 116 days to 
attain the dough stage, while the 10–15 July transplanted rice took 
84 days to attain 50% flowering and 101 days to attain the dough 
stages. Thermal time exerts great influence on the growth and yield of 
crops. Sattar et al. (2017) observed that the rice crop sown on 15 July 
required 2 days more to attain the maximum tillering stage than that 
sown on 31 May. However, the duration required to attain 50% 
flowering on 31 May and 15 July sown crops was 109 and 96 days, 
respectively. The crop sown on 31 May attained maturity in 142 days, 
while the crop sown on 31 July reached maturity in 119 days. 
Kobayashi et al. (2010) concluded that higher air temperature and 
incident radiation tend to advance anthesis in rice. Thus, delayed 
transplanting forced the crop to pass through a relatively lower 
temperature regime during its reproductive phase (Bal et al., 2023). 
They also reported significant variation in rice yield in response to 
weather variabilities during different growth phases of the crop under 
the diverse ecosystems of India. Srivastava et al. (2018) observed that 
with delayed transplanting, the percentage of chaffy grains per panicle 
increased, which resulted in reduced grain yields. This is in conformity 
with the results of previous research, where the setting of lower 
temperature resulted in the irregular opening of flowers and 
inadequate filling of the panicles (Venkataraman and Krishnan, 1992). 
The maximum temperature required for proper germination of pollen 
should be  33–34°C (Grist, 1986). Moreover, late transplanting 
produced lower yields due to the higher percentage of chaffy grains in 
the panicle under a non-congenial temperature regime (Anon, 2016). 
The formation of chaffy grains coincided with the prevalence of lower 
air temperature (Tmax < 32.5°C and Tmin < 23.0°C) during the 50% 
flowering to dough stage of rice crop (Sattar et al., 2017).
3.2 Effect of preponing sowing dates of 
rice on yield and productivity of 
succeeding wheat crop
In the rice–wheat–green gram cropping system, the HD-2967 
variety of wheat was sown on 7 November after the harvest of paddy 
on 30 October under a timely sown assured irrigation system, whereas 
in the farmers’ practice, wheat was sown during 25–30 November after 
the harvest of paddy crops during 15–20 November. Timely sowing of 
wheat in the cropping system in the experimental plots was made 
possible because of the timely harvesting of the previous rice crop. 
This resulted in a drastic change in yield and yield attributing 
characteristics of wheat. On average, a 61% increase in grain yield was 
observed for the crop sown at the appropriate sowing window,

compared to late sowing (Table 3). In one study at New Delhi, a 
decrease in wheat yield by 70, 29, and 77 kg ha−1 per day due to delay 
in sowing beyond the first week of November was observed in varieties 
HD-2932, WR-544, and HD-2967, respectively (Dubey et al., 2019). 
In our study, the total biological yield (both grain and straw) was 
51.3% higher in timely sown wheat (11.8 t ha−1), as compared to late-
sown wheat (7.8 t ha−1) with a 6.6% increase in harvest index. The 
lower grain, straw, and biological yields in the late-sown wheat might 
be due to the negative impact of higher temperature regimes and 
terminal heat stress during its flowering and milking stages (Sattar 
et al., 2020; Sattar and Srivastava, 2021). They reported enhanced 
productivity of rice–wheat cropping system in Indo-Gangetic plains 
through manipulation of sowing windows of both crops. The number 
of shoots per m2, number of spikes per m2, and number of grains per 
spike in the timely sown wheat were 9.0, 9.0, and 24.8% higher, 
respectively, as compared to late-sown wheat (Table 4 and Figure 5). 
The number of fertile spikelets and 1,000-grain weight were also found 
to be, respectively, 8.9 and 6.3% higher in timely sown wheat as 
compared to late-sown wheat, whereas the number of unfilled spikes 
was 9.4% higher in late-sown wheat as compared to timely sown 
wheat (Figure 6). In case of grain yield, it was observed to be 60.9% 
higher in timely sown wheat (4.9 t ha−1) as compared to late-sown 
wheat (3.05 t ha−1). Both maximum temperature and minimum 
temperature played a decisive role in determining the grain yield of 
wheat. Optimum thresholds of maximum and minimum temperatures 
during different growth stages of wheat for achieving higher yields in 
the study area revealed that temperature above 30.2°C during the 50% 
flowering to the milking stage and temperature above 33.1°C during 
the 50% flowering to maturity stage reduced grain yield below 
2.0 t ha−1. Similarly, a minimum temperature of 16.8°C during the 50% 
flowering to the milking stage and a minimum temperature of 18°C 
during the 50% flowering to maturity stage significantly affected the 
crop yield, and it produced a yield below 2.0 t ha−1. For achieving a 
yield target of 4.0 t ha−1 or more, Sattar et al. (2020) while working on 
crop weather relationships on wheat observed that the maximum and 
minimum temperatures from sowing to tiller formation should 
be  23.7 and 11.8°C, respectively. Similarly, the maximum and 
minimum temperatures from 50% flowering to milking should be 24.6 
and 11.6°C, respectively, and from 50% flowering to maturity, it 
should be 29.2 and 14.4°C, respectively (Table 5).
A comparative analysis of the ideal temperature (Table 5) suitable 
for wheat growth and actual temperature during the experimental 
years (Table 6) revealed that the wheat crop sown on 7 November 
experienced optimum temperature during flowering to maturity 
stages, while the late-sown crop encountered higher temperature, 
resulting in lesser number of panicles per m2, lesser number of grains 
per panicle, lesser 1,000-grain weight, and higher number of unfilled 
grains per m2. Moreover, there is a general trend of increasing 
minimum temperature and decreasing maximum temperature during 
the later growing period of wheat (Table 7), which tends to increase 
the rate of photorespiration and thereby reduces the net 
photosynthesis. Accordingly, the increase in minimum temperature 
in general tends to affect the process of anthesis to a great extent. It 
could be inferred from the results that the sowing of wheat around 7 
November instead of 25–30 November could reduce the negative 
impact of increasing temperature during the fag end of the growing 
season on the growth and yield of wheat and consequently help the 
farmers to achieve higher yield.
3.3 Changing rainfall patterns in the study 
area, crop water productivity, and effective 
rainfall for timely and late transplanted rice
Since we are discussing about the importance of monsoon rainfall, 
climatic risks and assured rainfall on rice productivity, and its 
sustainability under timely and late conditions, it would be prudent to 
assess the trend and variability of rainfall in the study area in relation 
to the water use and water productivity of rice. In this context, we have 
evaluated the change in rainfall patterns using time series data. The 
result revealed that rainfall in the study area has decreased 
significantly, leading to drier conditions in the recent 10-year period 
(Table 8). The maximum number of dry days during the monsoon 
season over the last 30 years (1990–2019) was observed to be 70 days, 
which increased to 87 days during the recent 10-year period (2010–
2019). The peak rate of increase in the number of dry days during 
monsoon is calculated as 1.5 days per year, signifying the decrease in 
annual rainy days in the region. Moreover, decreasing trends in annual 
rainfall were found to occur over the area. This poses a threat to the 
sustainability of rice crop production as more than 60% of rice is 
cultivated under rainfed conditions during monsoon season. Hence, 
erratic behavior of rainfall, decreasing number of rainy days, and 
increasing dry spell have enormous stakes in rice productivity. In this 
context, it is necessary to adopt climate-resilient interventions such as 
changing planting schedule, community irrigation approach, and 
provision of assured irrigation to sustain rice production in the region. 
A dry spell if coincided with critical growth stages of rice leads to 
reduced crop yield and sometimes crop failure. Sattar and Srivastava 
(2021) evaluated the performance of rice crops under different 
moisture regimes as induced by different planting dates and observed 
that shifting planting dates helped achieve higher water productivity 
and grain yield.
The data on water productivity and effective rainfall of timely 
and late transplanted rice grown at 17 locations of the study area 
revealed that the water productivity of timely transplanted kharif 
rice ranged from 0.673 kg m−3  ha−1 at Khodabanpur to 
1.052 kg m−3 ha−1 at Madhopur (Table 9 and Figure 7). On the other 
hand, it varied from 0.370 kg m−3  ha−1 at Bhagwanpur Hat to 
0.560 kg m−3 ha−1 at Madhopur for late transplanted rice. The highest 
water productivity of rice for both timely and late transplanted 
conditions was recorded for Madhopur, while lower values were 
observed for Khodabanpur. It was observed that the average water 
productivity of timely transplanted rice was 85.8% higher than that 
of late transplanted one. Studies showed that the water productivity 
of rice can be increased by shifting transplanting dates (Jalota et al., 
2009; Sattar and Srivastava, 2021). The higher water productivity of 
timely transplanted rice in comparison with late transplanted one 
may be attributed to higher yield, resulting from longer growing 
period and assured irrigation. The water productivity decreased with 
a decrease in crop duration when transplanting was delayed beyond 
30 June (Sattar and Srivastava, 2021). While considering the 
irrigation water productivity for timely and late transplanted rice, it 
was found to vary from a low of 2.38 kg m−3  ha−1 to a high of 
8.76 kg m−3  ha−1 and from 1.45 to 5.27 kg m−3  ha−1, respectively 
(Figure 8). The highest and the lowest values of irrigation water 
productivity under both conditions were associated with rice grown 
at Bhagwanpur Hat and Madhopur, respectively. The water 
productivity of rice in the present study under timely and late

conditions varies with other studies conducted elsewhere, perhaps 
due to differential growing environments, growing period length, 
water use, and grain yield. While working on rice water productivity, 
Tuong et al. (2005) reported an average water productivity of 0.4 kg 
grain m−3 with respect to total water input (irrigation plus rainfall). 
Under water-stressed environment, an increase in water productivity 
to 0.8–1.0 kg grain m−3 was reported (Kato et al., 2009; de Vries et al., 
2010). Zwart and Bastiaanssen (2004) estimated the water 
productivity and evapotranspiration requirement of rice as 
0.6–1.6 kg m−3 and 400–800 mm, respectively.
The variations in effective rainfall during the growing season of 
early and late transplanted rice are presented in Table 9. In general, the 
effective rainfall was higher for the late transplanted rice. The effective 
rainfall for timely transplanted rice ranged from a low of 553.0 mm to 
a high of 741.3 mm across the study area. In the case of late 
transplanted rice, it was found to vary from 658.8 to 825.3 mm. Since 
the late transplanted crop in farmers’ field faced moisture stress of 
varying intensity, the efficiency of rainwater utilization was much 
higher leading to higher effective rainfall. A small amount of rainfall 
in dry soils could be more useful and effective, whereas the same

amount of rainfall in wet soil may be insignificant. Chang (1963) 
observed that the effective rainfall increased with the storage capacity 
and drying condition of the soil. In the present study, lesser rainfall 
availed for late transplanted crops might have been more effective in 
meeting evapotranspiration requirements of the crop. On the other 
hand, for early transplanted crops, a higher fraction might have been 
ineffective due to seepage and percolation losses.
Considering water-saving methods, direct seeded rice (DSR) and 
System of Rice Intensification (SRI) planting methods of rice are gaining 
importance under water-stressed environments in the wake of climate 
change. At present, it is only about 2.5% of the total rice-growing area in 
Bihar. In the study area, the farmers tend to opt it for upland areas under 
conditions of erratic monsoon. On the other hand, the SRI method does 
not find any taker among the farmers of the region.
3.4 Effect of early wheat harvesting on the 
yield of subsequent green gram
The manipulation of sowing dates of both rice and wheat in the 
cropping system provided sufficient space and opportunity for the 
sowing of green gram at appropriate time with the provision of 
assured irrigation. Thus, the early sowing of rice–wheat helped us to 
achieve a grain yield of green gram to the tune of 7.21 t ha−1 (Table 10), 
whereas in the farmers’ practice, the yield was much lower (6.09 t ha−1). 
An obvious increase of 18.4% in the grain yield of green gram 
was recorded.
3.5 Effect of optimization of the sowing 
window on the system productivity and 
economics of rice–wheat–green gram 
system
The cropping intensity of experimental plots and the farmers’ 
practice was found to be >300%. However, the rice equivalent yield 
(REY) of timely sown assured irrigation plots was found to 
be 13.25 t ha−1, whereas under farmers’ practice (delayed condition), 
REY was observed as 8.89 t ha−1. The production efficiency was 
found to be 35.3 kg ha−1 day−1 for timely sown assured irrigation 
plots. On the other hand, it was paltry (24.0 kg ha−1 day−1) under 
farmers’ practice. In the case of the land use efficiency, it was found

4 Conclusion
By manipulating the sowing dates of rice and wheat, the adverse 
impacts of climate variability can be minimized to achieve higher 
system productivity. Moreover, the provision of an assured irrigation 
system can help ward off the negative impact of dry spells and 
unfavorable soil moisture regimes on rice production. The major 
source of irrigation is groundwater, which is extracted by diesel pump 
sets or by a three-phase 5/7.5 hp. electric pumping system. However, 
this requires high infrastructure, which is time taking, and voltage 
fluctuation is a major limiting factor. The high cost of irrigation 
coupled with the late onset of monsoon is also a major factor, which 
compels the farmers of the region to go for late sowing and late 
transplanting. Hence, the productivity of the crop remains low, and 
under such situation, the state is bound to grow rice in 3.2 million 
hectares to meet the food requirements. If infrastructure is created for 
less costly irrigation systems with 3-hp single-phase tube wells fitted 
with submersible pumps, the productivity can be increased by 50–60% 
and the food demand of the state can be supported with only 1.2–1.5 
million hectares of land with a lower cost of cultivation and lesser 
investment. Accordingly, the remaining land can be diversified for 
other cash crops and agri-entrepreneurship development. 
Alternatively, if rice cultivation is still continued in 3.2 million 
hectares, the production can be almost doubled. The same is the case 
with wheat, where we  can enhance the productivity from 2.9 to 
5.0 t ha−1 with timely sowing and assured irrigation to escape the 
impacts of terminal heat. With this productivity of wheat, the food 
demand of the state can be achieved with just 60% of the wheat 
growing area, and the leftover land can be  diversified for other 
enterprises. Green gram can be best suited in the rice–wheat system, 
if the provision of timely sowing and assured irrigation is made with 
the 
installation 
of 
3-hp 
single-phase 
tube 
wells 
with 
submersible pumps.
The results of the study showed that with the assured community 
irrigation system and shifting planting dates, the productivity of rice–
wheat cropping system can be achieved greater than 10.0 t ha−1 with a 
cropping intensity of 300% for better adaptation and sustainable 
production. Moreover, the water productivity of timely transplanted

rice was observed to be 85.8% higher than that of late transplanted 
one. With the application of our simple innovative technology, the 
negative impacts of climatic challenges on crop production can 
be  resolved to a large extent in the region for achieving higher 
productivity of rice–wheat cropping system. However, it is important 
to assess the impacts of the technology with regard to enhanced farm 
income, alleviation of rural poverty, and lesser energy utilization. On 
the other hand, the impact of the technology with respect to 
groundwater depletion would be a topic for further investigation for 
upscaling the benefits among the farmers at larger domain.
